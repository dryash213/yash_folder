16.1 Introduction
In earlier classes, we studied about the concept of
probability as a measure of uncertainty of various
phenomenon. We have obtained the probability of getting
3 1
an even number in throwing a die as i.e., . Here the
6 2
total possible outcomes are 1,2,3,4,5 and 6 (six in number).
The outcomes in favour of the event of ‘getting an even
number’ are 2,4,6 (i.e., three in number). In general, to
obtain the probability of an event, we find the ratio of the
number of outcomes favourable to the event, to the total
number of equally likely outcomes. This theory of probability Kolmogorov
is known as classical theory of probability. (1903-1987)
In Class IX, we learnt to find the probability on the basis of observations and
collected data. This is called statistical approach of probability.
Both the theories have some serious difficulties. For instance, these theories can
not be applied to the activities/experiments which have infinite number of outcomes. In
classical theory we assume all the outcomes to be equally likely. Recall that the outcomes
are called equally likely when we have no reason to believe that one is more likely to
occur than the other. In other words, we assume that all outcomes have equal chance
(probability) to occur. Thus, to define probability, we used equally likely or equally
probable outcomes. This is logically not a correct definition. Thus, another theory of
probability was developed by A.N. Kolmogorov, a Russian mathematician, in 1933. He
2022-23384 MATHEMATICS
laid down some axioms to interpret probability, in his book ‘Foundation of Probability’
published in 1933. In this Chapter, we will study about this approach called axiomatic
approach of probability. To understand this approach we must know about few basic
terms viz. random experiment, sample space, events, etc. Let us learn about these all,
in what follows next.
16.2 Random Experiments
In our day to day life, we perform many activities which have a fixed result no matter
any number of times they are repeated. For example given any triangle, without knowing
the three angles, we can definitely say that the sum of measure of angles is 180°.
We also perform many experimental activities, where the result may not be same,
when they are repeated under identical conditions. For example, when a coin is tossed
it may turn up a head or a tail, but we are not sure which one of these results will
actually be obtained. Such experiments are called random experiments.
An experiment is called random experiment if it satisfies the following two
conditions:
(i) It has more than one possible outcome.
(ii) It is not possible to predict the outcome in advance.
Check whether the experiment of tossing a die is random or not?
In this chapter, we shall refer the random experiment by experiment only unless
stated otherwise.
16.2.1 Outcomes and sample space A possible result of a random experiment is
called its outcome.
Consider the experiment of rolling a die. The outcomes of this experiment are 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, if we are interested in the number of dots on the upper face of the die.
The set of outcomes {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} is called the sample space of the experiment.
Thus, the set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment is called the sample
space associated with the experiment. Sample space is denoted by the symbol S.
Each element of the sample space is called a sample point. In other words, each
outcome of the random experiment is also called sample point.
Let us now consider some examples.
Example 1 Two coins (a one rupee coin and a two rupee coin) are tossed once. Find
a sample space.
Solution Clearly the coins are distinguishable in the sense that we can speak of the
first coin and the second coin. Since either coin can turn up Head (H) or Tail(T), the
possible outcomes may be
2022-23PROBABILITY 385
Heads on both coins = (H,H) = HH
Head on first coin and Tail on the other = (H,T) = HT
Tail on first coin and Head on the other = (T,H) = TH
Tail on both coins = (T,T) = TT
Thus, the sample space is S = {HH, HT, TH, TT}
A
Note The outcomes of this experiment are ordered pairs of H and T. For the
sake of simplicity the commas are omitted from the ordered pairs.
Example 2 Find the sample space associated with the experiment of rolling a pair of
dice (one is blue and the other red) once. Also, find the number of elements of this
sample space.
Solution Suppose 1 appears on blue die and 2 on the red die. We denote this outcome
by an ordered pair (1,2). Similarly, if ‘3’ appears on blue die and ‘5’ on red, the outcome
is denoted by the ordered pair (3,5).
In general each outcome can be denoted by the ordered pair (x, y), where x is
the number appeared on the blue die and y is the number appeared on the red die.
Therefore, this sample space is given by
S = {(x, y): x is the number on the blue die and y is the number on the red die}.
The number of elements of this sample space is 6 × 6 = 36 and the sample space is
given below:
{(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6)
(3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)
(5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)}
Example 3 In each of the following experiments specify appropriate sample space
(i) A boy has a 1 rupee coin, a 2 rupee coin and a 5 rupee coin in his pocket. He
takes out two coins out of his pocket, one after the other.
(ii) A person is noting down the number of accidents along a busy highway
during a year.
Solution (i) Let Q denote a 1 rupee coin, H denotes a 2 rupee coin and R denotes a 5
rupee coin. The first coin he takes out of his pocket may be any one of the three coins
Q, H or R. Corresponding to Q, the second draw may be H or R. So the result of two
draws may be QH or QR. Similarly, corresponding to H, the second draw may be
Q or R.
Therefore, the outcomes may be HQ or HR.Lastly, corresponding to R, the second
draw may be H or Q.
So, the outcomes may be RH or RQ.
2022-23386 MATHEMATICS
Thus, the sample space is S={QH, QR, HQ, HR, RH, RQ}
(ii) The number of accidents along a busy highway during the year of observation
can be either 0 (for no accident ) or 1 or 2, or some other positive integer.
Thus, a sample space associated with this experiment is S= {0,1,2,...}
Example 4 A coin is tossed. If it shows head, we draw a ball from a bag consisting of
3 blue and 4 white balls; if it shows tail we throw a die. Describe the sample space of
this experiment.
Solution Let us denote blue balls by B , B , B and the white balls by W , W , W , W .
1 2 3 1 2 3 4
Then a sample space of the experiment is
S = { HB , HB , HB , HW , HW , HW , HW , T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6}.
1 2 3 1 2 3 4
Here HB means head on the coin and ball B is drawn, HW means head on the coin
i i i
and ball W is drawn. Similarly, Ti means tail on the coin and the number i on the die.

Example 5 Consider the experiment in which a coin is tossed repeatedly until a head
comes up. Describe the sample space.
Solution In the experiment head may come up on the first toss, or the 2nd toss, or the
3rd toss and so on till head is obtained.Hence, the desired sample space is
S= {H, TH, TTH, TTTH, TTTTH,...}

16.3 Event
We have studied about random experiment and sample space associated with an
experiment. The sample space serves as an universal set for all questions concerned
with the experiment.
Consider the experiment of tossing a coin two times. An associated sample space
is S = {HH, HT, TH, TT}.
Now suppose that we are interested in those outcomes which correspond to the
occurrence of exactly one head. We find that HT and TH are the only elements of S
corresponding to the occurrence of this happening (event). These two elements form
the set E = { HT, TH}
We know that the set E is a subset of the sample space S . Similarly, we find the
following correspondence between events and subsets of S.
2022-23388 MATHEMATICS
Description of events Corresponding subset of ‘S’
Number of tails is exactly 2 A = {TT}
Number of tails is atleast one B = {HT, TH, TT}
Number of heads is atmost one C = {HT, TH, TT}
Second toss is not head D = { HT, TT}
Number of tails is atmost two S = {HH, HT, TH, TT}
Number of tails is more than two φ
The above discussion suggests that a subset of sample space is associated with
an event and an event is associated with a subset of sample space. In the light of this
we define an event as follows.
Definition Any subset E of a sample space S is called an event.
16.3.1 Occurrence of an event Consider the experiment of throwing a die. Let E
denotes the event “ a number less than 4 appears”. If actually ‘1’ had appeared on the
die then we say that event E has occurred. As a matter of fact if outcomes are 2 or 3,
we say that event E has occurred
Thus, the event E of a sample space S is said to have occurred if the outcome
ωof the experiment is such that ω∈ E. If the outcome ω is such that ω ∉ E, we say
that the event E has not occurred.
16.3.2 Types of events Events can be classified into various types on the basis of the
elements they have.
1. Impossible and Sure Events The empty set φ and the sample space S describe
events. In fact φ is called an impossible event and S, i.e., the whole sample space is
called the sure event.
To understand these let us consider the experiment of rolling a die. The associated
sample space is
S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
Let E be the event “ the number appears on the die is a multiple of 7”. Can you
write the subset associated with the event E?
Clearly no outcome satisfies the condition given in the event, i.e., no element of
the sample space ensures the occurrence of the event E. Thus, we say that the empty
set only correspond to the event E. In other words we can say that it is impossible to
have a multiple of 7 on the upper face of the die. Thus, the event E = φ is an impossible
event.
Now let us take up another event F “the number turns up is odd or even”. Clearly
2022-23PROBABILITY 389
F = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,} = S, i.e., all outcomes of the experiment ensure the occurrence of
the event F. Thus, the event F = S is a sure event.
2. Simple Event If an event E has only one sample point of a sample space, it is
called a simple (or elementary) event.
In a sample space containing n distinct elements, there are exactly n simple
events.
For example in the experiment of tossing two coins, a sample space is
S={HH, HT, TH, TT}
There are four simple events corresponding to this sample space. These are
E = {HH}, E ={HT}, E = { TH} and E ={TT}.
1 2 3 4
3. Compound Event If an event has more than one sample point, it is called a
Compound event.
For example, in the experiment of “tossing a coin thrice” the events
E: ‘Exactly one head appeared’
F: ‘Atleast one head appeared’
G: ‘Atmost one head appeared’ etc.
are all compound events. The subsets of S associated with these events are
E={HTT,THT,TTH}
F={HTT,THT, TTH, HHT, HTH, THH, HHH}
G= {TTT, THT, HTT, TTH}
Each of the above subsets contain more than one sample point, hence they are all
compound events.
16.3.3 Algebra of events In the Chapter on Sets, we have studied about different
ways of combining two or more sets, viz, union, intersection, difference, complement
of a set etc. Like-wise we can combine two or more events by using the analogous set
notations.
Let A, B, C be events associated with an experiment whose sample space is S.
1. Complementary Event For every event A, there corresponds another event
A′called the complementary event to A. It is also called the event ‘not A’.
For example, take the experiment ‘of tossing three coins’. An associated sample
space is
S = {HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, HTT, THT, TTH, TTT}
Let A={HTH, HHT, THH} be the event ‘only one tail appears’
Clearly for the outcome HTT, the event A has not occurred. But we may say that
the event ‘not A’ has occurred. Thus, with every outcome which is not in A, we say
that ‘not A’ occurs.
2022-23390 MATHEMATICS
Thus the complementary event ‘not A’ to the event A is
A′ = {HHH, HTT, THT, TTH, TTT}
or A′ = {ω : ω ∈ S and ω∉A} = S – A.
2. The Event ‘A or B’ Recall that union of two sets A and B denoted by A ∪ B
contains all those elements which are either in A or in B or in both.
When the sets A and B are two events associated with a sample space, then
‘A ∪ B’ is the event ‘either A or B or both’. This event ‘A ∪ B’ is also called ‘A or B’.
Therefore Event ‘A or B’ = A ∪ B
= {ω : ω ∈ A or ω∈ B}
3. The Event ‘A and B’ We know that intersection of two sets A ∩ B is the set of
those elements which are common to both A and B. i.e., which belong to both
‘A and B’.
If A and B are two events, then the set A ∩ B denotes the event ‘A and B’.
Thus, A ∩ B = {ω : ω ∈ A and ω ∈ B}
For example, in the experiment of ‘throwing a die twice’ Let A be the event
‘score on the first throw is six’ and B is the event ‘sum of two scores is atleast 11’ then
A ={(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)}, and B = {(5,6), (6,5), (6,6)}
so A ∩ B = {(6,5), (6,6)}
Note that the set A ∩ B = {(6,5), (6,6)} may represent the event ‘the score on the first
throw is six and the sum of the scores is atleast 11’.
4. The Event ‘A but not B’ We know that A–B is the set of all those elements
which are in A but not in B. Therefore, the set A–B may denote the event ‘A but not
B’.We know that
A – B = A ∩ B´
Example 6 Consider the experiment of rolling a die. Let A be the event ‘getting a
prime number’, B be the event ‘getting an odd number’. Write the sets representing
the events (i) Aor B (ii) A and B (iii) A but not B (iv) ‘not A’.
Solution Here S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, A = {2, 3, 5} and B = {1, 3, 5}
Obviously
(i) ‘A or B’ = A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 5}
(ii) ‘A and B’ = A ∩ B = {3,5}
(iii) ‘A but not B’ = A – B = {2}
(iv) ‘not A’ = A′ = {1,4,6}
2022-23PROBABILITY 391
16.3.4 Mutually exclusive events In the experiment of rolling a die, a sample space is
S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Consider events, A ‘an odd number appears’ and B ‘an even
number appears’
Clearly the event A excludes the event B and vice versa. In other words, there is
no outcome which ensures the occurrence of events A and B simultaneously. Here
A = {1, 3, 5} and B = {2, 4, 6}
Clearly A ∩ B = φ, i.e., A and B are disjoint sets.
In general, two events A and B are called mutually exclusive events if the
occurrence of any one of them excludes the occurrence of the other event, i.e., if they
can not occur simultaneously. In this case the sets A and B are disjoint.
Again in the experiment of rolling a die, consider the events A ‘an odd number
appears’ and event B ‘a number less than 4 appears’
Obviously A = {1, 3, 5} and B = {1, 2, 3}
Now 3 ∈ A as well as 3 ∈ B
Therefore, A and B are not mutually exclusive events.
Remark Simple events of a sample space are always mutually exclusive.
16.3.5 Exhaustive events Consider the experiment of throwing a die. We have
S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Let us define the following events
A: ‘a number less than 4 appears’,
B: ‘a number greater than 2 but less than 5 appears’
and C: ‘a number greater than 4 appears’.
Then A = {1, 2, 3}, B = {3,4} and C = {5, 6}. We observe that
A ∪ B ∪ C = {1, 2, 3} ∪ {3, 4} ∪ {5, 6} = S.
Such events A, B and C are called exhaustive events. In general, if E , E , ..., E are n
1 2 n
events of a sample space S and if
n
E ∪E ∪E ∪...∪E =∪E =S
1 2 3 n i
i=1
then E , E , ...., E are called exhaustive events.In other words, events E , E , ..., E
1 2 n 1 2 n
are said to be exhaustive if atleast one of them necessarily occurs whenever the
experiment is performed.
Further, if E ∩ E = φ for i ≠ j i.e., events E and E are pairwise disjoint and
i j i j
n
∪E =S, then events E , E , ..., E are called mutually exclusive and exhaustive
i=1 i 1 2 n
events.
2022-23392 MATHEMATICS
We now consider some examples.
Example 7 Two dice are thrown and the sum of the numbers which come up on the
dice is noted. Let us consider the following events associated with this experiment
A: ‘the sum is even’.
B: ‘the sum is a multiple of 3’.
C: ‘the sum is less than 4’.
D: ‘the sum is greater than 11’.
Which pairs of these events are mutually exclusive?
Solution There are 36 elements in the sample space S = {(x, y): x, y = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.
Then
A = {(1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 2), (4, 4),
(4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 6)}
B = {(1, 2), (2, 1), (1, 5), (5, 1), (3, 3), (2, 4), (4, 2), (3, 6), (6, 3), (4, 5), (5, 4),
(6, 6)}
C = {(1, 1), (2, 1), (1, 2)} and D = {(6, 6)}
We find that
A ∩ B = {(1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (5, 1), (6, 6)} ≠ φ
Therefore, A and B are not mutually exclusive events.
Similarly A ∩ C ≠ φ, A ∩ D ≠ φ, B ∩ C ≠ φ and B ∩ D ≠ φ.
Thus, the pairs of events, (A, C), (A, D), (B, C), (B, D) are not mutually exclusive
events.
Also C ∩ D = φ and so C and D are mutually exclusive events.
Example 8 A coin is tossed three times, consider the following events.
A: ‘No head appears’, B: ‘Exactly one head appears’ and C: ‘Atleast two heads
appear’.
Do they form a set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive events?
Solution The sample space of the experiment is
S = {HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, HTT, THT, TTH, TTT}
and A = {TTT}, B = {HTT, THT, TTH}, C = {HHT, HTH, THH, HHH}
Now
A ∪ B ∪ C = {TTT, HTT, THT, TTH, HHT, HTH, THH, HHH} = S
Therefore, A, B and C are exhaustive events.
Also, A ∩ B = φ, A ∩ C = φ and B ∩ C = φ
Therefore, the events are pair-wise disjoint, i.e., they are mutually exclusive.
Hence, A, B and C form a set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive events.

16.4 Axiomatic Approach to Probability
In earlier sections, we have considered random experiments, sample space and
events associated with these experiments. In our day to day life we use many words
about the chances of occurrence of events. Probability theory attempts to quantify
these chances of occurrence or non occurrence of events.
In earlier classes, we have studied some methods of assigning probability to an
event associated with an experiment having known the number of total outcomes.
Axiomatic approach is another way of describing probability of an event. In this
approach some axioms or rules are depicted to assign probabilities.
Let S be the sample space of a random experiment. The probability P is a real
valued function whose domain is the power set of S and range is the interval [0,1]
satisfying the following axioms
(i) For any event E, P (E) ≥0 (ii) P (S) = 1
(iii) If E and F are mutually exclusive events, then P(E ∪ F) = P(E) + P(F).
It follows from (iii) that P(φ) = 0. To prove this, we take F = φ and note that E and φ
are disjoint events. Therefore, from axiom (iii), we get
P (E ∪ φ) = P (E) + P (φ) or P(E) = P(E) + P (φ) i.e. P (φ) = 0.
Let S be a sample space containing outcomes ω ,ω ,...,ω , i.e.,
1 2 n
S = {ω , ω , ..., ω }
1 2 n
It follows from the axiomatic definition of probability that
(i) 0 ≤ P (ω) ≤ 1 for each ω ∈ S
i i
(ii) P (ω ) + P (ω ) + ... + P (ω ) = 1
1 2 n
(iii) For any event A, P(A) = ∑ P(ω ), ω ∈ A.
i i
A
Note It may be noted that the singleton {ω} is called elementary event and
i
for notational convenience, we write P(ω ) for P({ω }).

For example, in ‘a coin tossing’ experiment we can assign the number to each
2
of the outcomes H and T.
1 1
i.e. P(H) = and P(T) = (1)
2 2
Clearly this assignment satisfies both the conditions i.e., each number is neither
less than zero nor greater than 1 and
2022-23PROBABILITY 395
1 1
P(H) + P(T) = + = 1
2 2
1 1
Therefore, in this case we can say that probability of H = , and probability of T =
2 2
1 3
If we take P(H) = and P(T) = ... (2)
4 4
Does this assignment satisfy the conditions of axiomatic approach?
1 3
Yes, in this case, probability of H = and probability of T = .
4 4
We find that both the assignments (1) and (2) are valid for probability of
H and T.
In fact, we can assign the numbers p and (1 – p) to both the outcomes such that
0 ≤ p ≤ 1 and P(H) + P(T) = p + (1 – p) = 1
This assignment, too, satisfies both conditions of the axiomatic approach of
probability. Hence, we can say that there are many ways (rather infinite) to assign
probabilities to outcomes of an experiment. We now consider some examples.

assignments of probabilities to each outcome are valid?

16.4.1 Probability of an event Let S be a sample space associated with the experiment
‘examining three consecutive pens produced by a machine and classified as Good
(non-defective) and bad (defective)’. We may get 0, 1, 2 or 3 defective pens as result
of this examination.
A sample space associated with this experiment is
S = {BBB, BBG, BGB, GBB, BGG, GBG, GGB, GGG},
where B stands for a defective or bad pen and G for a non – defective or good pen.
Let the probabilities assigned to the outcomes be as follows

Probability:

Let event A: there is exactly one defective pen and event B: there are atleast two

Hence A = {BGG, GBG, GGB} and B = {BBG, BGB, GBB, BBB}
Now P(A) = ∑P(ω ),∀ω ∈A

Clearly this assignment satisfies the conditions of axiomatic approach. Now, let

P(E)= =

16.4.3 Probability of the event ‘A or B’ Let us now find the probability of event
‘A or B’, i.e., P (A ∪ B)
Let A = {HHT, HTH, THH} and B = {HTH, THH, HHH} be two events associated
with ‘tossing of a coin thrice’
Clearly A ∪ B = {HHT, HTH, THH, HHH}
Now P (A ∪ B) = P(HHT) + P(HTH) + P(THH) + P(HHH)
2022-23398 MATHEMATICS
If all the outcomes are equally likely, then
1 1 1 1 4 1
P(A∪B)= + + + = =

Also P(A) = P(HHT) + P(HTH) + P(THH) =

and P(B) = P(HTH) + P(THH) + P(HHH) =
8
3 3 6
Therefore P(A) + P(B) = + =
8 8 8
It is clear that P(A∪B) ≠ P(A) + P(B)
The points HTH and THH are common to both A and B. In the computation of
P(A) + P(B) the probabilities of points HTH and THH, i.e., the elements of A ∩B are
included twice. Thus to get the probability P(A∪B) we have to subtract the probabilities
of the sample points in A ∩ B from P(A) + P(B)
i.e. P(A∪B) = P(A)+P(B)−∑P(ω),∀ω ∈A ∩B
i i
= P(A)+P(B)−P(A ∩B)
Thus we observe that, P(A∪B)=P(A)+P(B)−P(A∩B)
In general, if A and B are any two events associated with a random experiment,
then by the definition of probability of an event, we have
P(A∪B)=∑p(ω ),∀ω ∈A ∪B.
i i
Since A∪B=(A–B)∪(A∩B)∪(B–A),
we have
P(A ∪ B) = [∑P(ω)∀ω ∈(A–B)]+[∑P(ω)∀ω∈A∩B]+ [∑P(ω)∀ω∈B –A]
i i i i i i
(because A–B, A ∩ B and B – A are mutually exclusive) ... (1)
Also P(A)+P(B)=[∑p(ω)∀ω∈A]+[∑p(ω)∀ω ∈B]
i i i i
= [∑P(ω)∀ω ∈(A–B)∪(A∩B)]+ [∑P(ω)∀ω ∈(B –A)∪(A ∩B)]
i i i i
= [∑P(ω)∀ω ∈(A – B)]+[∑P(ω)∀ω ∈(A ∩B)]+ [∑P(ω)∀ω ∈(B–A)]+
i i i i i i
[∑P(ω)∀ω ∈(A∩B)]
i i
= P(A∪B)+[∑P(ω)∀ω ∈A ∩B] [using (1)]
i i
= P(A∪B)+P(A∩B).
2022-23PROBABILITY 399
Hence P(A∪B)=P(A)+P(B) –P(A∩B).
Alternatively, it can also be proved as follows:
A ∪ B = A ∪ (B – A), where A and B – A are mutually exclusive,
and B = (A ∩ B) ∪ (B – A), where A ∩ B and B – A are mutually exclusive.
Using Axiom (iii) of probability, we get
P (A ∪B) = P (A) + P (B – A) ... (2)
and P(B) = P ( A ∩ B) + P (B – A) ... (3)
Subtracting (3) from (2) gives
P (A ∪ B) – P(B) = P(A) – P (A ∩ B)
or P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P (B) – P (A ∩ B)
The above result can further be verified by observing the Venn Diagram (Fig 16.1)
Fig 16.1
If A and B are disjoint sets, i.e., they are mutually exclusive events, then A ∩ B = φ
Therefore P(A∩B)=P(φ)=0
Thus, for mutually exclusive events A and B, we have
P(A∪B)=P(A)+P(B),
which is Axiom (iii) of probability.
16.4.4 Probability of event ‘not A’ Consider the event A = {2, 4, 6, 8} associated
with the experiment of drawing a card from a deck of ten cards numbered from
1 to 10. Clearly the sample space is S = {1, 2, 3, ...,10}
If all the outcomes 1, 2, ...,10 are considered to be equally likely, then the probability
1
of each outcome is

Now P(A) = P(2) + P(4) + P(6) + P(8)
1 1 1 1 4 2
= + + + = =
10 10 10 10 10 5
Also event ‘not A’ = A′ = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10}
Now P(A′) =P(1) + P(3) + P(5) + P(7) + P(9) + P(10)
6 3
= =
10 5
3 2
Thus, P(A′) = = 1− =1−P(A)
5 5
Also, we know that A′ and A are mutually exclusive and exhaustive events i.e.,
A ∩ A′ = φ and A ∪ A′ = S
or P(A ∪ A′) = P(S)
Now P(A) + P(A′) = 1, by using axioms (ii) and (iii).
or P(A′) = P(not A) = 1 – P(A)
We now consider some examples and exercises having equally likely outcomes
unless stated otherwise.
Example 10 One card is drawn from a well shuffled deck of 52 cards. If each outcome
is equally likely, calculate the probability that the card will be
(i) a diamond (ii) not an ace
(iii) a black card (i.e., a club or, a spade) (iv) not a diamond
(v) not a black card.
Solution When a card is drawn from a well shuffled deck of 52 cards, the number of
possible outcomes is 52.
(i) Let A be the event 'the card drawn is a diamond'
Clearly the number of elements in set A is 13.
13 1
Therefore, P(A) = =
52 4

i.e. probability of a diamond card =
4
(ii) We assume that the event ‘Card drawn is an ace’ is B
Therefore ‘Card drawn is not an ace’ should be B′.

We know that P(B′) = 1 – P(B) = 1− =1− =

(iii) Let C denote the event ‘card drawn is black card’
Therefore, number of elements in the set C = 26

i.e. P(C) = =
52 2

Thus, probability of a black card = .
2
(iv) We assumed in (i) above that A is the event ‘card drawn is a diamond’,
so the event ‘card drawn is not a diamond’ may be denoted as A' or ‘not A’
1 3
Now P(not A) = 1 – P(A) = 1− =
4 4
(v) The event ‘card drawn is not a black card’ may be denoted as C′ or ‘not C’.

We know that P(not C) = 1 – P(C) = 1− =

Therefore, probability of not a black card =

Example 11 A bag contains 9 discs of which 4 are red, 3 are blue and 2 are yellow.
The discs are similar in shape and size. A disc is drawn at random from the bag.
Calculate the probability that it will be (i) red, (ii) yellow, (iii) blue, (iv) not blue,
(v) either red or blue.
Solution There are 9 discs in all so the total number of possible outcomes is 9.
Let the events A, B, C be defined as
A: ‘the disc drawn is red’
B: ‘the disc drawn is yellow’
C: ‘the disc drawn is blue’.
(i) The number of red discs = 4, i.e., n (A) = 4
4
Hence P(A) =
9
(ii) The number of yellow discs = 2, i.e., n (B) = 2
2
Therefore, P(B) =
9
(iii) The number of blue discs = 3, i.e., n(C) = 3
2022-23402 MATHEMATICS

Therefore, P(C) = =

(iv) Clearly the event ‘not blue’ is ‘not C’. We know that P(not C) = 1 – P(C)
1 2
Therefore P(not C) = 1− =

(v) The event ‘either red or blue’ may be described by the set ‘A or C’
Since,A and C are mutually exclusive events, we have

P(A or C) = P (A ∪ C) = P(A) + P(C) = + =

Example 12 Two students Anil and Ashima appeared in an examination. The probability
that Anil will qualify the examination is 0.05 and that Ashima will qualify the examination
is 0.10. The probability that both will qualify the examination is 0.02. Find the
probability that
(a) Both Anil and Ashima will not qualify the examination.
(b) Atleast one of them will not qualify the examination and
(c) Only one of them will qualify the examination.
Solution Let E and F denote the events that Anil and Ashima will qualify the examination,
respectively. Given that
P(E) = 0.05, P(F) = 0.10 and P(E ∩ F) = 0.02.
Then
(a) The event ‘both Anil and Ashima will not qualify the examination’ may be
expressed as E´ ∩ F´.
Since,E´ is ‘not E’, i.e., Anil will not qualify the examination and F´ is ‘not F’, i.e.,
Ashima will not qualify the examination.
Also E´ ∩ F´ = (E ∪ F)´ (by Demorgan's Law)
Now P(E ∪ F) = P(E) + P(F) – P(E ∩ F)
or P(E ∪ F) = 0.05 + 0.10 – 0.02 = 0.13
Therefore P(E´ ∩ F´) = P(E ∪ F)´ = 1 – P(E ∪ F) = 1 – 0.13 = 0.87
(b) P (atleast one of them will not qualify)
= 1 – P(both of them will qualify)
= 1 – 0.02 = 0.98
2022-23PROBABILITY 403
(c) The event only one of them will qualify the examination is same as the event
either (Anil will qualify, and Ashima will not qualify) or (Anil will not qualify and Ashima
will qualify) i.e., E ∩ F´ or E´ ∩ F, where E ∩ F´ and E´ ∩ F are mutually exclusive.
Therefore, P(only one of them will qualify) = P(E ∩ F´ or E´ ∩ F)
= P(E ∩ F´) + P(E´ ∩ F) = P (E) – P(E ∩ F) + P(F) – P (E ∩ F)
= 0.05 – 0.02 + 0.10 – 0.02 = 0.11
Example 13 A committee of two persons is selected from two men and two women.
What is the probability that the committee will have (a) no man? (b) one man? (c) two
men?
Solution The total number of persons = 2 + 2 = 4. Out of these four person, two can
be selected in 4C ways.
2
(a) No men in the committee of two means there will be two women in the committee.
Out of two women, two can be selected in 2C =1 way.
2
2C 1×2×1 1
Therefore P(no man)= 2 = =
4C 4×3 6

(b) One man in the committee means that there is one woman. One man out of 2
can be selected in 2C ways and one woman out of 2 can be selected in 2C ways.
1 1
Together they can be selected in 2C × 2C ways.
1 1
2C ×2C 2×2 2
Therefore P(One man)= 1 1 = =

(c) Two men can be selected in 2C way.

Hence P(Two men)= 2 = =

order. What is the probability that she visits
(i) A before B? (ii) A before B and B before C?

(v) A just before B?
Solution The number of arrangements (orders) in which Veena can visit four cities A,

Summary
In this Chapter, we studied about the axiomatic approach of probability. The main
features of this Chapter are as follows:
®
Sample space: The set of all possible outcomes
®
Sample points: Elements of sample space
®
Event: A subset of the sample space
®
Impossible event : The empty set
®
Sure event: The whole sample space
®
Complementary event or ‘not event’ : The set A′ or S – A
®
Event A or B: The set A ∪ B
®
Event A and B: The set A ∩ B
®
Event A and not B: The set A – B
®
Mutually exclusive event: A and B are mutually exclusive if A ∩ B = φ
®
Exhaustive and mutually exclusive events: Events E , E ,..., E are mutually
1 2 n
exclusive and exhaustive if E ∪ E ∪ ...∪ E = S and E ∩ E = φ V i ≠ j
1 2 n i j
®
Probability: Number P (ω) associated with sample point ω such that
i i
(i) 0 ≤ P (ω) ≤ 1 (ii)
∑P(ω )
for all ω ∈ S = 1
i i i
(iii) P(A) =
∑P(ω )
for all ω ∈A. The number P (ω) is called probability
i i i
of the outcome ω.
i
®
Equally likely outcomes: All outcomes with equal probability
®
Probability of an event: For a finite sample space with equally likely outcomes
n(A)
Probability of an event P(A)= , where n(A) = number of elements in
n(S)
the set A, n(S) = number of elements in the set S.
®
If A and B are any two events, then
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) – P(A and B)
equivalently, P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) – P(A ∩ B)
®
If A and B are mutually exclusive, then P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)
®
If A is any event, then
P(not A) = 1 – P(A)

Historical Note
Probability theory like many other branches of mathematics, evolved out of
practical consideration. It had its origin in the 16th century when an Italian physician
and mathematician Jerome Cardan (1501–1576) wrote the first book on the subject
“Book on Games of Chance” (Biber de Ludo Aleae). It was published in 1663
after his death.
In 1654, a gambler Chevalier de Metre approached the well known French
Philosopher and Mathematician Blaise Pascal (1623–1662) for certain dice
problem. Pascal became interested in these problems and discussed with famous
French Mathematician Pierre de Fermat (1601–1665). Both Pascal and Fermat
solved the problem independently. Besides, Pascal and Fermat, outstanding
contributions to probability theory were also made by Christian Huygenes (1629–
1665), a Dutchman, J. Bernoulli (1654–1705), De Moivre (1667–1754), a
Frenchman Pierre Laplace (1749–1827), the Russian P.L Chebyshev (1821–1897),
A. A Markov (1856–1922) and A. N Kolmogorove (1903–1987). Kolmogorov is
credited with the axiomatic theory of probability. His book ‘Foundations of
Probability’ published in 1933, introduces probability as a set function and is
considered a classic.
