3.1 Introduction
The word ‘trigonometry’ is derived from the Greek words
‘trigon’ and ‘metron’ and it means ‘measuring the sides of
a triangle’. The subject was originally developed to solve
geometric problems involving triangles. It was studied by
sea captains for navigation, surveyor to map out the new
lands, by engineers and others. Currently, trigonometry is
used in many areas such as the science of seismology,
designing electric circuits, describing the state of an atom,
predicting the heights of tides in the ocean, analysing a
musical tone and in many other areas.
In earlier classes, we have studied the trigonometric
Arya Bhatt
ratios of acute angles as the ratio of the sides of a right (476-550)
angled triangle. We have also studied the trigonometric identities and application of
trigonometric ratios in solving the problems related to heights and distances. In this
Chapter, we will generalise the concept of trigonometric ratios to trigonometric functions
and study their properties.
3.2 Angles
Angle is a measure of rotation of a given ray about its initial point. The original ray is
Vertex
Fig 3.1
2024-2544 MATHEMATICS
called the initial side and the final position of the ray after rotation is called the
terminal side of the angle. The point of rotation is called the vertex. If the direction of
rotation is anticlockwise, the angle is said to be positive and if the direction of rotation
is clockwise, then the angle is negative (Fig 3.1).
The measure of an angle is the amount of
rotation performed to get the terminal side from
the initial side. There are several units for
measuring angles. The definition of an angle Fig 3.2
suggests a unit, viz. one complete revolution from the position of the initial side as
indicated in Fig 3.2.
This is often convenient for large angles. For example, we can say that a rapidly
spinning wheel is making an angle of say 15 revolution per second. We shall describe
two other units of measurement of an angle which are most commonly used, viz.
degree measure and radian measure.
th
 1 
3.2.1 Degree measure If a rotation from the initial side to terminal side is   of
360
a revolution, the angle is said to have a measure of one degree, written as 1°. A degree is
divided into 60 minutes, and a minute is divided into 60 seconds . One sixtieth of a degree is
called a minute, written as 1′, and one sixtieth of a minute is called a second, written as 1″.
Thus, 1° = 60′, 1′ = 60″
Some of the angles whose measures are 360°,180°, 270°, 420°, – 30°, – 420° are
shown in Fig 3.3.

2024-25TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS 45
3.2.2 Radian measure There is another unit for measurement of an angle, called
the radian measure. Angle subtended at the centre by an arc of length 1 unit in a
unit circle (circle of radius 1 unit) is said to have a measure of 1 radian. In the Fig
3.4(i) to (iv), OA is the initial side and OB is the terminal side. The figures show the
1 1
angles whose measures are 1 radian, –1 radian, 1 radian and –1 radian.

(iv)
Fig 3.4 (i) to (iv)
We know that the circumference of a circle of radius 1 unit is 2π. Thus, one
complete revolution of the initial side subtends an angle of 2π radian.
More generally, in a circle of radius r, an arc of length r will subtend an angle of
1 radian. It is well-known that equal arcs of a circle subtend equal angle at the centre.
Since in a circle of radius r, an arc of length r subtends an angle whose measure is 1
l
radian, an arc of length l will subtend an angle whose measure is radian. Thus, if in
r
a circle of radius r, an arc of length l subtends an angle θ radian at the centre, we have
l
θ = or l = r θ.

3.2.3 Relation between radian and real numbers
2
Consider the unit circle with centre O. Let A be any point
on the circle. Consider OA as initial side of an angle.
Then the length of an arc of the circle will give the radian
1
measure of the angle which the arc will subtend at the
centre of the circle. Consider the line PAQ which is
1 A
tangent to the circle at A. Let the point A represent the O 0
real number zero, AP represents positive real number and
AQ represents negative real numbers (Fig 3.5). If we
−1
rope the line AP in the anticlockwise direction along the
circle, and AQ in the clockwise direction, then every real
number will correspond to a radian measure and −2
conversely. Thus, radian measures and real numbers can Fig 3.5 Q
be considered as one and the same.
3.2.4 Relation between degree and radian Since a circle subtends at the centre
an angle whose radian measure is 2π and its degree measure is 360°, it follows that
2π radian = 360° or π radian = 180°
The above relation enables us to express a radian measure in terms of degree
measure and a degree measure in terms of radian measure. Using approximate value
22
of π as , we have

Notational Convention
Since angles are measured either in degrees or in radians, we adopt the convention
that whenever we write angle θ°, we mean the angle whose degree measure is θ and
whenever we write angle β, we mean the angle whose radian measure is β.
Note that when an angle is expressed in radians, the word ‘radian’ is frequently
π π
omitted. Thus, π=180°and =45° are written with the understanding that π and
4 4
are radian measures. Thus, we can say that
π
Radian measure = ×Degree measure

Degree measure = ×Radian measure
π
Example 1 Convert 40° 20′ into radian measure.
Solution We know that 180° = π radian.

Hence 40° 20′ = 40 degree = × radian = radian.

Therefore 40° 20′ = radian.

Hence 6 radians = 343° 38′ 11″ approximately.

3.3 Trigonometric Functions
In earlier classes, we have studied trigonometric ratios for acute angles as the ratio of
sides of a right angled triangle. We will now extend the definition of trigonometric
ratios to any angle in terms of radian measure and study them as trigonometric functions.
Consider a unit circle with centre
at origin of the coordinate axes. Let
P (a, b) be any point on the circle with
angle AOP = x radian, i.e., length of arc
AP = x (Fig 3.6).
We define cos x = a and sin x = b
Since ∆OMP is a right triangle, we have
OM2 + MP2 = OP2 or a2 + b2 = 1
Thus, for every point on the unit circle,
we have
a2 + b2 = 1 or cos2 x + sin2 x = 1
Since one complete revolution
subtends an angle of 2π radian at the
π
centre of the circle, ∠AOB = , Fig 3.6
2
2024-2550 MATHEMATICS
3π π
∠AOC = π and ∠AOD = . All angles which are integral multiples of are called
2 2
quadrantal angles. The coordinates of the points A, B, C and D are, respectively,
(1, 0), (0, 1), (–1, 0) and (0, –1). Therefore, for quadrantal angles, we have
cos 0°= 1 sin 0° = 0,
π π
cos = 0 sin = 1
2 2
cosπ= − 1 sinπ = 0
3π 3π
cos = 0 sin = –1
2 2
cos 2π= 1 sin 2π = 0
Now, if we take one complete revolution from the point P, we again come back to
same point P. Thus, we also observe that if x increases (or decreases) by any integral
multiple of 2π, the values of sine and cosine functions do not change. Thus,
sin (2nπ + x) = sinx, n ∈ Z , cos (2nπ + x) = cosx, n ∈ Z
Further, sin x = 0, if x = 0, ± π, ± 2π , ± 3π, ..., i.e., when x is an integral multiple of π
π 3π 5π
and cos x = 0, if x = ± , ± , ± , ... i.e., cos x vanishes when x is an odd
2 2 2
π
multiple of . Thus
2
sin x = 0 implies x = nπππππ,,,,, where n is any integer
π
cos x = 0 implies x = (2n + 1) , where n is any integer.
2
We now define other trigonometric functions in terms of sine and cosine functions:
1
cosec x = , x ≠ nπ, where n is any integer.
sinx
1 π
sec x = , x ≠ (2n + 1) , where n is any integer.
cosx 2

tan x = , x ≠ (2n +1) , where n is any integer.
cosx 2
cosx
cot x = , x ≠ n π, where n is any integer.

2024-25TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS 51
We have shown that for all real x, sin2 x + cos2 x = 1
It follows that
1 + tan2 x = sec2 x (why?)
1 + cot2 x = cosec2 x (why?)
In earlier classes, we have discussed the values of trigonometric ratios for 0°,
30°, 45°, 60° and 90°. The values of trigonometric functions for these angles are same
as that of trigonometric ratios studied in earlier classes. Thus, we have the following

The values of cosec x, sec x and cot x
are the reciprocal of the values of sin x,
cos x and tan x, respectively.
3.3.1 Sign of trigonometric functions
Let P (a, b) be a point on the unit circle
with centre at the origin such that
∠AOP = x. If ∠AOQ = – x, then the
coordinates of the point Q will be (a, –b)
(Fig 3.7). Therefore
cos (– x) = cos x
and sin (– x) = – sin x
Since for every point P (a, b) on
the unit circle, – 1 ≤ a ≤ 1 and Fig 3.7
2024-2552 MATHEMATICS
– 1 ≤ b ≤ 1, we have – 1 ≤ cos x ≤ 1 and –1 ≤ sin x ≤ 1 for all x. We have learnt in
π
previous classes that in the first quadrant (0 < x < ) a and b are both positive, in the
2
π
second quadrant ( < x <π) a is negative and b is positive, in the third quadrant
2
3π 3π
(π < x < ) a and b are both negative and in the fourth quadrant ( < x < 2π) a is
2 2
positive and b is negative. Therefore, sin x is positive for 0 < x < π, and negative for
π π 3π
π < x < 2π. Similarly, cos x is positive for 0 < x < , negative for < x < and also
2 2 2
3π
positive for < x < 2π. Likewise, we can find the signs of other trigonometric
2
functions in different quadrants. In fact, we have the following table.

3.3.2 Domain and range of trigonometric functions From the definition of sine
and cosine functions, we observe that they are defined for all real numbers. Further,
we observe that for each real number x,
– 1 ≤ sin x ≤ 1 and – 1 ≤ cos x ≤ 1
Thus, domain of y = sin x and y = cos x is the set of all real numbers and range
is the interval [–1, 1], i.e., – 1 ≤ y ≤ 1.
2024-25TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS 53
1
Since cosec x = , the domain of y = cosec x is the set { x : x ∈ R and
sinx
x ≠ n π, n ∈ Z} and range is the set {y : y ∈ R, y ≥ 1 or y ≤ – 1}. Similarly, the domain
π
of y = sec x is the set {x : x ∈ R and x ≠ (2n + 1) , n ∈ Z} and range is the set
2
{y : y ∈ R, y ≤ – 1or y ≥ 1}. The domain of y = tan x is the set {x : x ∈ R and
π
x ≠ (2n + 1) , n ∈ Z} and range is the set of all real numbers. The domain of
2
y = cot x is the set {x : x ∈ R and x ≠ n π, n ∈ Z} and the range is the set of all real
numbers.
π
We further observe that in the first quadrant, as x increases from 0 to , sin x
2
π
increases from 0 to 1, as x increases from to π, sin x decreases from 1 to 0. In the
2
3π
third quadrant, as x increases from π to , sin x decreases from 0 to –1and finally, in
2
3π
the fourth quadrant, sin x increases from –1 to 0 as x increases from to 2π.
2
Similarly, we can discuss the behaviour of other trigonometric functions. In fact, we
have the following table:
I quadrant II quadrant III quadrant IV quadrant
sin increases from 0 to 1 decreases from 1 to 0 decreases from 0 to –1 increases from –1 to 0
cos decreases from 1 to 0 decreases from 0 to – 1 increases from –1 to 0 increases from 0 to 1
tan increases from 0 to ∞ increases from –∞to 0 increases from 0 to ∞ increases from –∞to 0
cot decreases from ∞ to 0 decreases from 0 to–∞ decreases from ∞ to 0 decreases from 0to –∞
sec increases from 1 to ∞ increases from –∞to–1 decreases from –1to–∞ decreases from ∞ to 1
cosec decreases from ∞ to 1 increases from 1 to ∞ increases from –∞to–1 decreases from–1to–∞
Remark In the above table, the statement tan x increases from 0 to ∞ (infinity) for
π π
0 < x < simply means that tan x increases as x increases for 0 < x < and
2 2
2024-2554 MATHEMATICS
π
assumes arbitraily large positive values as x approaches to . Similarly, to say that
2
cosec x decreases from –1 to – ∞ (minus infinity) in the fourth quadrant means that
3π
cosec x decreases for x ∈ ( , 2π) and assumes arbitrarily large negative values as
2
x approaches to 2π. The symbols ∞ and – ∞ simply specify certain types of behaviour
of functions and variables.
We have already seen that values of sin x and cos x repeats after an interval of
2π. Hence, values of cosec x and sec x will also repeat after an interval of 2π. We

Fig 3.10 Fig 3.11
2024-25TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS 55
Fig 3.12 Fig 3.13
shall see in the next section that tan (π + x) = tan x. Hence, values of tan x will repeat
after an interval of π. Since cot x is reciprocal of tan x, its values will also repeat after
an interval of π. Using this knowledge and behaviour of trigonometic functions, we can
sketch the graph of these functions. The graph of these functions are given above:

3.4 Trigonometric Functions of Sum and Difference of Two Angles
In this Section, we shall derive expressions for trigonometric functions of the sum and
difference of two numbers (angles) and related expressions. The basic results in this
connection are called trigonometric identities. We have seen that
1. sin (– x) = – sin x
2. cos (– x) = cos x
We shall now prove some more results:
2024-2558 MATHEMATICS
3. cos (x + y) = cos x cos y – sin x sin y
Consider the unit circle with centre at the origin. Letx be the angle P OP and y be
4 1
the angle P OP . Then (x + y) is the angle P OP . Also let (– y) be the angle P OP .
1 2 4 2 4 3
Therefore, P , P , P and P will have the coordinates P (cos x, sin x),
1 2 3 4 1
P [cos (x + y), sin (x + y)], P [cos (– y), sin (– y)] and P (1, 0) (Fig 3.14).
2 3 4
Fig 3.14
Consider the triangles P OP and P OP . They are congruent (Why?). Therefore,
1 3 2 4
P P and P P are equal. By using distance formula, we get
1 3 2 4
P P 2 = [cos x – cos (– y)]2 + [sin x – sin(–y]2
1 3
= (cos x – cos y)2 + (sin x + sin y)2
= cos2 x + cos2 y – 2 cos x cos y + sin2 x + sin2 y + 2sin x sin y
= 2 – 2 (cos x cos y – sin x sin y) (Why?)
Also, P P 2 = [1 – cos (x + y)] 2 + [0 – sin (x + y)]2
2 4
= 1 – 2cos (x + y) + cos2 (x + y) + sin2 (x + y)
= 2 – 2 cos (x + y)
2024-25TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS 59
Since P P = P P , we have P P 2 = P P 2.
1 3 2 4 1 3 2 4
Therefore, 2 –2 (cos x cos y – sin x sin y) = 2 – 2 cos (x + y).
Hence cos (x + y) = cos x cos y – sin x sin y
4. cos (x – y) = cos x cos y + sin x sin y
Replacing y by – y in identity 3, we get
cos (x + (– y)) = cos x cos (– y) – sin x sin (– y)
or cos (x – y) = cos x cos y + sin x sin y

9. By taking suitable values of x and y in the identities 3, 4, 7 and 8, we get the
following results:
π π
cos ( +x) = – sin x sin ( +x) = cos x

cos (πππππ – x) = – cos x sin (πππππ – x) = sin x

cos (πππππ + x) = – cos x sin (πππππ + x) = – sin x
cos (2πππππ – x) = cos x sin (2πππππ – x) = – sin x
Similar results for tan x, cot x, sec x and cosec x can be obtained from the results of sin
x and cos x.

2024-25TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS 61
Since, none of the x, y and (x + y) is multiple of π, we find that sin x sin y and
sin (x + y) are non-zero. Now,
cos(x+ y) cosxcos y –sin xsin y
cot ( x + y)= =
sin(x+ y) sin xcos y+cos xsin y
Dividing numerator and denominator by sin x sin y, we have
cotxcoty–1
cot (x + y) =
coty+cotx
cotxcot y+1
13. cot (x – y)= if none of angles x, y and x–y is a multiple of π
cot y –cotx
If we replace y by –y in identity 12, we get the result

14. cos 2x = cos2x – sin2 x = 2 cos2 x – 1 = 1 – 2 sin2 x =

Replacing y by x, we get
cos 2x =cos2x – sin2 x
=cos2x – (1 – cos2 x) = 2 cos2x – 1
Again, cos 2x =cos2 x – sin2 x
=1 – sin2 x – sin2 x = 1 – 2 sin2x.

We have cos 2x =cos2 x – sin 2 x =

We have,

Historical Note
The study of trigonometry was first started in India. The ancient Indian
Mathematicians, Aryabhatta (476), Brahmagupta (598), Bhaskara I (600) and
Bhaskara II (1114) got important results. All this knowledge first went from
India to middle-east and from there to Europe. The Greeks had also started the
study of trigonometry but their approach was so clumsy that when the Indian
approach became known, it was immediately adopted throughout the world.
In India, the predecessor of the modern trigonometric functions, known as
the sine of an angle, and the introduction of the sine function represents the main
contribution of the siddhantas (Sanskrit astronomical works) to the history of
mathematics.
Bhaskara I (about 600) gave formulae to find the values of sine functions
for angles more than 90°. A sixteenth century Malayalam work Yuktibhasa
(period) contains a proof for the expansion of sin (A + B). Exact expression for
sines or cosines of 18°, 36°, 54°, 72°, etc., are given by
Bhaskara II.
2024-25TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS 75
The symbols sin–1 x, cos–1 x, etc., for arc sin x, arc cos x, etc., were
suggested by the astronomer Sir John F.W. Hersehel (1813) The names of Thales
(about 600 B.C.) is invariably associated with height and distance problems. He
is credited with the determination of the height of a great pyramid in Egypt by
measuring shadows of the pyramid and an auxiliary staff (or gnomon) of known
height, and comparing the ratios:
H h
= = tan (sun’s altitude)
S s
Thales is also said to have calculated the distance of a ship at sea through
the proportionality of sides of similar triangles. Problems on height and distance
using the similarity property are also found in ancient Indian works.
