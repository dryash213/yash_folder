       "'As we look at our surroundings, we see a large\\n variety of things with different shapes, sizes\\n and textures. Everything in this universe is\\n made up of material which scientists have\\n named “matter”. The air we breathe, the food\\n we eat, stones, clouds, stars, plants and\\n animals, even a small drop of water or a\\n particle of sand — every thing is matter. We\\n can also see as we look around that all the\\n things mentioned above occupy space and\\n have mass. In other words, they have both\\n mass* and volume**.\\n Since early times, human beings have\\n been trying to understand their surroundings.\\n Early Indian philosophers classified matter in\\n the form of five basic elements — the “Panch\\n Tatva” — air, earth, fire, sky and water.\\n According to them everything, living or nonliving,\\n was made up of these five basic\\n elements. Ancient Greek philosophers had\\n arrived at a similar classification of matter.\\n Modern day scientists have evolved two\\n types of classification of matter based on their\\n physical properties and chemical nature.\\n In this chapter we shall learn about\\n matter based on its physical properties.\\n Chemical aspects of matter will be taken up\\n in subsequent chapters.\\n 1.1 Physical Nature of Matter\\n 1.1.1 MATTER IS MADE UP OF PARTICLES\\n For a long time, two schools of thought prevailed\\n regarding the nature of matter. One school\\n believed matter to be continuous like a block\\n of wood, whereas, the other thought that matter\\n was made up of particles like sand. Let us\\n perform an activity to decide about the nature\\n of matter — is it continuous or particulate?\\n Activity ______________ 1.1\\n • Take a 100 mL beaker.\\n • Fill half the beaker with water and\\n mark the level of water.\\n • Dissolve some salt/ sugar with the help\\n of a glass rod.\\n • Observe any change in water level.\\n • What do you think has happened to\\n the salt?\\n • Where does it disappear?\\n • Does the level of water change?\\n In order to answer these questions we\\n need to use the idea that matter is made up\\n of particles. What was there in the spoon, salt\\n or sugar, has now spread throughout water.\\n This is illustrated in Fig. 1.1.\\n 1.1.2 HOW SMALL ARE THESE PARTICLES\\n OF MATTER?\\n Activity ______________ 1.2\\n • Take 2–3 crystals of potassium\\n permanganate and dissolve them in\\n 100 mL of water.\\n Fig. 1.1: When we dissolve salt in water, the particles\\n of salt get into the spaces between particles\\n of water.\\n * The SI unit of mass is kilogram (kg).\\n ** The SI unit of volume is cubic metre (m3). The common unit of measuring volume is\\n litre (L) such that 1L = 1 dm3, 1L = 1000 mL, 1 mL = 1 cm3.\\n 1\\n MATTER IN OUR SURROUNDINGS\\n Chapter\\n 2024-25\\n 2 SCIENCE\\n • Take out approximately 10 mL of this\\n solution and put it into 90 mL of clear\\n water.\\n • Take out 10 mL of this solution and\\n put it into another 90 mL of clear water.\\n • Keep diluting the solution like this 5 to\\n 8 times.\\n • Is the water still coloured ?\\n 1.2.2 PARTICLES OF MATTER ARE\\n CONTINUOUSLY MOVING\\n Activity 1.3\\n • Put an unlit incense stick in a corner\\n of your class. How close do you have to\\n go near it so as to get its smell?\\n • Now light the incense stick. What\\n happens? Do you get the smell sitting\\n at a distance?\\n • Record your observations.\\n Activity 1.4\\n • Take two glasses/beakers filled with\\n water.\\n • Put a drop of blue or red ink slowly\\n and carefully along the sides of the first\\n beaker and honey in the same way in\\n the second beaker.\\n • Leave them undisturbed in your house\\n or in a corner of the class.\\n • Record your observations.\\n • What do you observe immediately after\\n adding the ink drop?\\n • What do you observe immediately after\\n adding a drop of honey?\\n • How many hours or days does it take\\n for the colour of ink to spread evenly\\n throughout the water?\\n Activity 1.5\\n • Drop a crystal of copper sulphate or\\n potassium permanganate into a glass\\n of hot water and another containing\\n cold water. Do not stir the solution.\\n Allow the crystals to settle at the\\n bottom.\\n • What do you observe just above the\\n solid crystal in the glass?\\n • What happens as time passes?\\n • What does this suggest about the\\n particles of solid and liquid?\\n • Does the rate of mixing change with\\n temperature? Why and how?\\n From the above three activities (1.3, 1.4 and\\n 1.5), we can conclude the following:\\n Fig. 1.2: Estimating how small are the particles of\\n matter. With every dilution, though the colour\\n becomes light, it is still visible.\\n This experiment shows that just a few\\n crystals of potassium permanganate can\\n colour a large volume of water (about\\n 1000 L). So we conclude that there must be\\n millions of tiny particles in just one crystal\\n of potassium permanganate, which keep\\n on dividing themselves into smaller and\\n smaller particles.\\n The same activity can be done using 2 mL\\n of Dettol instead of potassium permanganate.\\n The smell can be detected even on\\n repeated dilution.\\n The particles of matter are very small –\\n they are small beyond our imagination!!!!\\n 1.2 Characteristics of Particles of\\n Matter\\n 1.2.1 PARTICLES OF MATTER HAVE SPACE\\n BETWEEN THEM\\n In activities 1.1 and 1.2 we saw that particles\\n of sugar, salt, Dettol, or potassium\\n permanganate got evenly distributed in water.\\n Similarly, when we make tea, coffee or\\n lemonade (nimbu paani ), particles of one type\\n of matter get into the spaces between particles\\n of the other. This shows that there is enough\\n space between particles of matter.\\n 2024-25\\n MATTER IN OUR SURROUNDINGS 3\\n • If we consider each student as a\\n particle of matter, then in which group\\n the particles held each other with the\\n maximum force?\\n Activity ______________ 1.7\\n • Take an iron nail, a piece of chalk and\\n a rubber band.\\n • Try breaking them by hammering,\\n cutting or stretching.\\n • In which of the above three\\n substances do you think the particles\\n are held together with greater force?\\n Activity ______________ 1.8\\n • Take some water in a container, try\\n cutting the surface of water with your\\n fingers.\\n • Were you able to cut the surface of\\n water?\\n • What could be the reason behind the\\n surface of water remaining together?\\n The above three activities (1.6, 1.7 and 1.8)\\n suggest that particles of matter have force\\n acting between them. This force keeps the\\n particles together. The strength of this force of\\n attraction varies from one kind of matter to\\n another.\\n uestions\\n 1. Which of the following are\\n matter?\\n Chair, air, love, smell, hate,\\n almonds, thought, cold, lemon\\n water, smell of perfume.\\n 2. Give reasons for the following\\n observation:\\n The smell of hot sizzling food\\n reaches you several metres\\n away, but to get the smell from\\n cold food you have to go close.\\n 3. A diver is able to cut through\\n water in a swimming pool. Which\\n property of matter does this\\n observation show?\\n 4. What are the characteristics of\\n the particles of matter?\\n Particles of matter are continuously\\n moving, that is, they possess what we call\\n the kinetic energy. As the temperature rises,\\n particles move faster. So, we can say that with\\n increase in temperature the kinetic energy of\\n the particles also increases.\\n In the above three activities we observe\\n that particles of matter intermix on their own\\n with each other. They do so by getting into\\n the spaces between the particles. This\\n intermixing of particles of two different types\\n of matter on their own is called diffusion. We\\n also observe that on heating, diffusion\\n becomes faster. Why does this happen?\\n 1.2.3 PARTICLES OF MATTER ATTRACT\\n EACH OTHER\\n Activity ______________ 1.6\\n • Play this game in the field— make four\\n groups and form human chains as\\n suggested:\\n • The first group should hold each\\n other from the back and lock arms\\n like Idu-Mishmi dancers (Fig. 1.3).\\n Fig. 1.3\\n • The second group should hold hands\\n to form a human chain.\\n • The third group should form a chain\\n by touching each other with only their\\n finger tips.\\n • Now, the fourth group of students\\n should run around and try to break the\\n three human chains one by one into\\n as many small groups as possible.\\n • Which group was the easiest to break?\\n Why?\\n Q\\n 2024-25\\n 4 SCIENCE\\n 1.3 States of Matter\\n Observe different types of matter around you.\\n What are its different states? We can see that\\n matter around us exists in three different\\n states– solid, liquid and gas. These states of\\n matter arise due to the variation in the\\n characteristics of the particles of matter.\\n Now, let us study about the properties of\\n these three states of matter in detail.\\n 1.3.1 THE SOLID STATE\\n Activity _____________ 1.9\\n • Collect the following articles — a pen,\\n a book, a needle and a piece of wooden\\n stick.\\n • Sketch the shape of the above articles\\n in your notebook by moving a pencil\\n around them.\\n • Do all these have a definite shape,\\n distinct boundaries and a fixed volume?\\n • What happens if they are hammered,\\n pulled or dropped?\\n • Are these capable of diffusing into each\\n other?\\n • Try compressing them by applying\\n force. Are you able to compress them?\\n All the above are examples of solids. We\\n can observe that all these have a definite\\n shape, distinct boundaries and fixed volumes,\\n that is, have negligible compressibility. Solids\\n have a tendency to maintain their shape when\\n subjected to outside force. Solids may break\\n under force but it is difficult to change their\\n shape, so they are rigid.\\n Consider the following:\\n (a) What about a rubber band, can it\\n change its shape on stretching? Is it\\n a solid?\\n (b) What about sugar and salt? When\\n kept in different jars these take the\\n shape of the jar. Are they solid?\\n (c) What about a sponge? It is a solid\\n yet we are able to compress it. Why?\\n All the above are solids as:\\n • A rubber band changes shape under\\n force and regains the same shape when\\n the force is removed. If excessive force is\\n applied, it breaks.\\n • The shape of each individual sugar or\\n salt crystal remains fixed, whether we\\n take it in our hand, put it in a plate or in\\n a jar.\\n • A sponge has minute holes, in which\\n air is trapped, when we press it, the air\\n is expelled out and we are able to\\n compress it.\\n 1.3.2 THE LIQUID STATE\\n Activity _____________1.10\\n • Collect the following:\\n (a) water, cooking oil, milk, juice, a\\n cold drink.\\n (b) containers of different shapes. Put\\n a 50 mL mark on these containers\\n using a measuring cylinder from\\n the laboratory.\\n • What will happen if these liquids are\\n spilt on the floor?\\n • Measure 50 mL of any one liquid and\\n transfer it into different containers one\\n by one. Does the volume remain the\\n same?\\n • Does the shape of the liquid remain the\\n same ?\\n • When you pour the liquid from one\\n container into another, does it flow\\n easily?\\n We observe that liquids have no fixed\\n shape but have a fixed volume. They take up\\n the shape of the container in which they are\\n kept. Liquids flow and change shape, so they\\n are not rigid but can be called fluid.\\n Refer to activities 1.4 and 1.5 where we\\n saw that solids and liquids can diffuse into\\n liquids. The gases from the atmosphere\\n diffuse and dissolve in water. These gases,\\n especially oxygen and carbon dioxide, are\\n essential for the survival of aquatic animals\\n and plants.\\n All living creatures need to breathe for\\n survival. The aquatic animals can breathe\\n under water due to the presence of dissolved\\n oxygen in water. Thus, we may conclude that\\n solids, liquids and gases can diffuse into\\n liquids. The rate of diffusion of liquids is\\n 2024-25\\n MATTER IN OUR SURROUNDINGS 5\\n higher than that of solids. This is due to the\\n fact that in the liquid state, particles move\\n freely and have greater space between each\\n other as compared to particles in the solid\\n state.\\n 1.3.3 THE GASEOUS STATE\\n Have you ever observed a balloon seller filling\\n a large number of balloons from a single\\n cylinder of gas? Enquire from him how many\\n balloons is he able to fill from one cylinder.\\n Ask him which gas does he have in the cylinder.\\n Activity _____________1.11\\n • Take three 100 mL syringes and close\\n their nozzles by rubber corks, as\\n shown in Fig.1.4.\\n • Remove the pistons from all the\\n syringes.\\n • Leaving one syringe untouched, fill\\n water in the second and pieces of chalk\\n in the third.\\n • Insert the pistons back into the\\n syringes. You may apply some vaseline\\n on the pistons before inserting them\\n into the syringes for their smooth\\n movement.\\n • Now, try to compress the content by\\n pushing the piston in each syringe.\\n We have observed that gases are highly\\n compressible as compared to solids and\\n liquids. The liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)\\n cylinder that we get in our home for cooking\\n or the oxygen supplied to hospitals in\\n cylinders is compressed gas. Compressed\\n natural gas (CNG) is used as fuel these days\\n in vehicles. Due to its high compressibility,\\n large volumes of a gas can be compressed\\n into a small cylinder and transported easily.\\n We come to know of what is being cooked\\n in the kitchen without even entering there,\\n by the smell that reaches our nostrils. How\\n does this smell reach us? The particles of the\\n aroma of food mix with the particles of air\\n spread from the kitchen, reach us and even\\n farther away. The smell of hot cooked food\\n reaches us in seconds; compare this with the\\n rate of diffusion of solids and liquids. Due to\\n high speed of particles and large space\\n between them, gases show the property of\\n diffusing very fast into other gases.\\n In the gaseous state, the particles move\\n about randomly at high speed. Due to this\\n random movement, the particles hit each\\n other and also the walls of the container. The\\n pressure exerted by the gas is because of this\\n force exerted by gas particles per unit area\\n on the walls of the container.\\n Fig. 1.4\\n • What do you observe? In which case\\n was the piston easily pushed in?\\n • What do you infer from your\\n observations?\\n Fig.1.5: a, b and c show the magnified schematic\\n pictures of the three states of matter. The\\n motion of the particles can be seen and\\n compared in the three states of matter.\\n 2024-25\\n 6 SCIENCE\\n 1.4.1 EFFECT OF CHANGE OF TEMPERATURE\\n Activity _____________1.12\\n • Take about 150 g of ice in a beaker and\\n suspend a laboratory thermometer so\\n that its bulb is in contact with the ice,\\n as in Fig. 1.6.\\n uestions\\n 1. The mass per unit volume of a\\n substance is called density.\\n (density = mass/volume).\\n Arrange the following in order of\\n increasing density – air, exhaust\\n from chimneys, honey, water,\\n chalk, cotton and iron.\\n 2. (a) Tabulate the differences in\\n the characterisitcs of states\\n of matter.\\n (b) Comment upon the following:\\n rigidity, compressibility,\\n fluidity, filling a gas\\n container, shape, kinetic\\n energy and density.\\n 3. Give reasons\\n (a) A gas fills completely the\\n vessel in which it is kept.\\n (b) A gas exerts pressure on the\\n walls of the container.\\n (c) A wooden table should be\\n called a solid.\\n (d) We can easily move our hand\\n in air but to do the same\\n through a solid block of wood\\n we need a karate expert.\\n 4. Liquids generally have lower\\n density as compared to solids.\\n But you must have observed that\\n ice floats on water. Find out why.\\n 1.4 Can Matter Change its State?\\n We all know from our observation that water\\n can exist in three states of matter–\\n • solid, as ice,\\n • liquid, as the familiar water, and\\n • gas, as water vapour.\\n What happens inside the matter during\\n this change of state? What happens to the\\n particles of matter during the change of\\n states? How does this change of state take\\n place? We need answers to these questions,\\n isn’t it?\\n Q\\n (a)\\n (b)\\n Fig. 1.6: (a) Conversion of ice to water, (b) conversion\\n of water to water vapour\\n 2024-25\\n MATTER IN OUR SURROUNDINGS 7\\n • Start heating the beaker on a low flame.\\n • Note the temperature when the ice\\n starts melting.\\n • Note the temperature when all the ice\\n has converted into water.\\n • Record your observations for this\\n conversion of solid to liquid state.\\n • Now, put a glass rod in the beaker and\\n heat while stirring till the water starts\\n boiling.\\n • Keep a careful eye on the thermometer\\n reading till most of the water has\\n vaporised.\\n • Record your observations for the\\n conversion of water in the liquid state\\n to the gaseous state.\\n On increasing the temperature of solids,\\n the kinetic energy of the particles increases.\\n Due to the increase in kinetic energy, the\\n particles start vibrating with greater speed.\\n The energy supplied by heat overcomes the\\n forces of attraction between the particles. The\\n particles leave their fixed positions and start\\n moving more freely. A stage is reached when\\n the solid melts and is converted to a liquid.\\n The minimum temperature at which a solid\\n melts to become a liquid at the atmospheric\\n pressure is called its melting point.\\n The melting point of a solid is an indication\\n of the strength of the force of attraction\\n between its particles.\\n The melting point of ice is 273.15 K*. The\\n process of melting, that is, change of solid\\n state into liquid state is also known as fusion.\\n When a solid melts, its temperature\\n remains the same, so where does the heat\\n energy go?\\n You must have observed, during the\\n experiment of melting, that the temperature\\n of the system does not change after the\\n melting point is reached, till all the ice melts.\\n This happens even though we continue to\\n heat the beaker, that is, we continue to supply\\n heat. This heat gets used up in changing the\\n state by overcoming the forces of attraction\\n between the particles. As this heat energy is\\n absorbed by ice without showing any rise in\\n temperature, it is considered that it gets\\n hidden into the contents of the beaker and is\\n known as the latent heat. The word latent\\n means hidden. The amount of heat energy\\n that is required to change 1 kg of a solid into\\n liquid at atmospheric pressure at its melting\\n point is known as the latent heat of fusion.\\n So, particles in water at 0oC (273 K) have more\\n energy as compared to particles in ice at the\\n same temperature.\\n When we supply heat energy to water,\\n particles start moving even faster. At a certain\\n temperature, a point is reached when the\\n particles have enough energy to break free\\n from the forces of attraction of each other. At\\n this temperature the liquid starts changing\\n into gas. The temperature at which a liquid\\n starts boiling at the atmospheric pressure is\\n known as its boiling point. Boiling is a bulk\\n phenomenon. Particles from the bulk of the\\n liquid gain enough energy to change into the\\n vapour state.\\n For water this temperature is 373 K\\n (100oC = 273 + 100 = 373 K).\\n Can you define the latent heat of\\n vaporisation? Do it in the same way as we\\n have defined the latent heat of fusion.\\n Particles in steam, that is, water vapour at\\n 373 K (1000 C) have more energy than water\\n at the same temperature. This is because\\n particles in steam have absorbed extra energy\\n in the form of latent heat of vaporisation.\\n *Note: Kelvin is the SI unit of temperature, 0\\n o C =273.15 K. For convenience, we take 0\\n o C = 273 K after\\n rounding off the decimal. To change a temperature on the Kelvin scale to the Celsius scale you\\n have to subtract 273 from the given temperature, and to convert a temperature on the Celsius\\n scale to the Kelvin scale you have to add 273 to the given temperature.\\n So, we infer that the state of matter can\\n be changed into another state by changing\\n the temperature.\\n We have learnt that substances around\\n us change state from solid to liquid and from\\n liquid to gas on application of heat. But there\\n 2024-25\\n 8 SCIENCE\\n enclosed in a cylinder? Will the particles come\\n closer? Do you think that increasing or\\n decreasing the pressure can change the state\\n of matter?\\n are some that change directly from solid state\\n to gaseous state and vice versa without\\n changing into the liquid state.\\n Activity _____________1.13\\n • Take some camphor. Crush it and put\\n it in a china dish.\\n • Put an inverted funnel over the china\\n dish.\\n • Put a cotton plug on the stem of the\\n funnel, as shown in Fig. 1.7.\\n * atmosphere (atm) is a unit of measuring pressure exerted by a gas. The unit of pressure is Pascal (Pa):\\n 1 atmosphere = 1.01 × 105 Pa. The pressure of air in atmosphere is called atmospheric pressure. The\\n atmospheric pressure at sea level is 1 atmosphere, and is taken as the normal atmospheric pressure.\\n Fig. 1.7: Sublimation of camphor\\n Fig. 1.8: By applying pressure, particles of matter\\n can be brought close together\\n Applying pressure and reducing\\n temperature can liquefy gases.\\n Have you heard of solid carbon dioxide\\n (CO2)? It is stored under high pressure. Solid\\n CO2 gets converted directly into gaseous state\\n on decrease of pressure to 1 atmosphere*\\n without coming into liquid state. This is the\\n reason that solid carbon dioxide is also known\\n as dry ice.\\n Thus, we can say that pressure and\\n temperature determine the state of a\\n substance, whether it will be solid, liquid\\n or gas.\\n • Now, heat slowly and observe.\\n • What do you infer from the above\\n activity?\\n A change of state directly from solid to gas\\n without changing into liquid state is called\\n sublimation and the direct change of gas to\\n solid without changing into liquid is called\\n deposition.\\n 1.4.2 EFFECT OF CHANGE OF PRESSURE\\n We have already learnt that the difference in\\n various states of matter is due to the\\n difference in the distances between the\\n constituent particles. What will happen when\\n we start putting pressure and compress a gas Fig. 1.9: Interconversion of the three states of matter\\n Deposition\\n 2024-25\\n MATTER IN OUR SURROUNDINGS 9\\n dish and keep it inside a cupboard or\\n on a shelf in your class.\\n • Record the room temperature.\\n • Record the time or days taken for the\\n evaporation process in the above cases.\\n • Repeat the above three steps of activity\\n on a rainy day and record your\\n observations.\\n • What do you infer about the effect of\\n temperature, surface area and wind\\n velocity (speed) on evaporation?\\n You must have observed that the rate of\\n evaporation increases with–\\n • an increase of surface area:\\n We know that evaporation is a surface\\n phenomenon. If the surface area is\\n increased, the rate of evaporation\\n increases. For example, while putting\\n clothes for drying up we spread them out.\\n • an increase of temperature:\\n With the increase of temperature, more\\n number of particles get enough kinetic\\n energy to go into the vapour state.\\n • a decrease in humidity:\\n Humidity is the amount of water vapour\\n present in air. The air around us cannot\\n hold more than a definite amount of\\n water vapour at a given temperature. If\\n the amount of water in air is already high,\\n the rate of evaporation decreases.\\n • an increase in wind speed:\\n It is a common observation that clothes\\n dry faster on a windy day. With the\\n increase in wind speed, the particles of\\n water vapour move away with the wind,\\n decreasing the amount of water vapour\\n in the surrounding.\\n 1.5.2 HOW DOES EVAPORATION CAUSE\\n COOLING?\\n In an open vessel, the liquid keeps on\\n evaporating. The particles of liquid absorb\\n energy from the surrounding to regain the\\n energy lost during evaporation. This\\n absorption of energy from the surroundings\\n make the surroundings cold.\\n uestions\\n 1. Convert the following temperature\\n to celsius scale:\\n a. 300 K b. 573 K\\n 2. What is the physical state of\\n water at:\\n a. 250oC b. 100oC ?\\n 3. For any substance, why does the\\n temperature remain constant\\n during the change of state?\\n 4. Suggest a method to liquefy\\n atmospheric gases.\\n 1.5 Evaporation\\n Do we always need to heat or change pressure\\n for changing the state of matter? Can you\\n quote some examples from everyday life where\\n change of state from liquid to vapour takes\\n place without the liquid reaching the boiling\\n point? Water, when left uncovered, slowly\\n changes into vapour. Wet clothes dry up. What\\n happens to water in the above two examples?\\n We know that particles of matter are\\n always moving and are never at rest. At a given\\n temperature in any gas, liquid or solid, there\\n are particles with different amounts of kinetic\\n energy. In the case of liquids, a small fraction\\n of particles at the surface, having higher\\n kinetic energy, is able to break away from the\\n forces of attraction of other particles and gets\\n converted into vapour. This phenomenon of\\n change of liquid into vapours at any\\n temperature below its boiling point is called\\n evaporation.\\n 1.5.1 FACTORS AFFECTING\\n EVAPORATION\\n Let us understand this with an activity.\\n Activity _____________1.14\\n • Take 5 mL of water in a test tube and\\n keep it near a window or under a fan.\\n • Take 5 mL of water in an open china\\n dish and keep it near a window or\\n under a fan.\\n • Take 5 mL of water in an open china\\n Q\\n 2024-25\\n 10 SCIENCE\\n What\\n you have\\n learnt\\n • Matter is made up of small particles.\\n • The matter around us exists in three states—solid, liquid\\n and gas.\\n • The forces of attraction between the particles are maximum in\\n solids, intermediate in liquids and minimum in gases.\\n • The spaces in between the constituent particles and kinetic\\n energy of the particles are minimum in the case of solids,\\n intermediate in liquids and maximum in gases.\\n What happens when you pour some\\n acetone (nail polish remover) on your palm?\\n The particles gain energy from your palm or\\n surroundings and evaporate causing the palm\\n to feel cool.\\n After a hot sunny day, people sprinkle\\n water on the roof or open ground because\\n the large latent heat of vaporisation of water\\n helps to cool the hot surface.\\n Can you cite some more examples from\\n daily life where we can feel the effect of cooling\\n due to evaporation?\\n Why should we wear cotton clothes in\\n summer?\\n During summer, we perspire more\\n because of the mechanism of our body which\\n keeps us cool. We know that during\\n evaporation, the particles at the surface of\\n the liquid gain energy from the surroundings\\n or body surface and change into vapour. The\\n heat energy equal to the latent heat of\\n vaporisation is absorbed from the body\\n leaving the body cool. Cotton, being a good\\n absorber of water helps in absorbing the\\n sweat and exposing it to the atmosphere for\\n easy evaporation.\\n Why do we see water droplets on the outer\\n surface of a glass containing ice-cold\\n water?\\n Let us take some ice-cold water in a\\n tumbler. Soon we will see water droplets on\\n the outer surface of the tumbler. The water\\n vapour present in air, on coming in contact\\n with the cold glass of water, loses energy and\\n gets converted to liquid state, which we see\\n as water droplets.\\n uestions\\n 1. Why does a desert cooler cool\\n better on a hot dry day?\\n 2. How does the water kept in an\\n earthen pot (matka) become cool\\n during summer?\\n 3. Why does our palm feel cold\\n when we put some acetone or\\n petrol or perfume on it?\\n 4. Why are we able to sip hot tea or\\n milk faster from a saucer rather\\n than a cup?\\n 5.

       "\"9\\nCHAPTER\\nLight – Reflection and\\nRefraction\\nWe see a variety of objects in the world around us. However, we are\\nunable to see anything in a dark room. On lighting up the room,\\nthings become visible. What makes things visible? During the day, the\\nsunlight helps us to see objects. An object reflects light that falls on it.\\nThis reflected light, when received by our eyes, enables us to see things.\\nWe are able to see through a transparent medium as light is transmitted\\nthrough it. There are a number of common wonderful phenomena\\nassociated with light such as image formation by mirrors, the twinkling\\nof stars, the beautiful colours of a rainbow, bending of light by a medium\\nand so on. A study of the properties of light helps us to explore them.\\nBy observing the common optical phenomena around us, we may\\nconclude that light seems to travel in straight lines. The fact that a small\\nsource of light casts a sharp shadow of an opaque object points to this\\nstraight-line path of light, usually indicated as a ray of light.\\n134 Science\\n!wonK\\not\\neroM\\nIf an opaque object on the path of light becomes very small, light has a tendency to\\nbend around it and not walk in a straight line – an effect known as the diffraction of\\nlight. Then the straight-line treatment of optics using rays fails. To explain phenomena\\nsuch as diffraction, light is thought of as a wave, the details of which you will study\\nin higher classes. Again, at the beginning of the 20th century, it became known that\\nthe wave theory of light often becomes inadequate for treatment of the interaction of\\nlight with matter, and light often behaves somewhat like a stream of particles. This\\nconfusion about the true nature of light continued for some years till a modern\\nquantum theory of light emerged in which light is neither a ‘wave’ nor a ‘particle’ –\\nthe new theory reconciles the particle properties of light with the wave nature.\\nIn this Chapter, we shall study the phenomena of reflection and\\nrefraction of light using the straight-line propagation of light. These basic\\nconcepts will help us in the study of some of the optical phenomena in\\nnature. We shall try to understand in this Chapter the reflection of light\\nby spherical mirrors and refraction of light and their application in real\\nlife situations.\\n99999.....11111 RRRRREEEEEFFFFFLLLLLEEEEECCCCCTTTTTIIIIIOOOOONNNNN OOOOOFFFFF LLLLLIIIIIGGGGGHHHHHTTTTT\\nA highly polished surface, such as a mirror, reflects most of the light\\nfalling on it. You are already familiar with the laws of reflection of light.\\n2024-25Let us recall these laws –\\n(i) The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection, and\\n(ii) The incident ray, the normal to the mirror at the point of incidence\\nand the reflected ray, all lie in the same plane.\\nThese laws of reflection are applicable to all types of reflecting surfaces\\nincluding spherical surfaces. You are familiar with the formation of image\\nby a plane mirror. What are the properties of the image? Image formed\\nby a plane mirror is always virtual and erect. The size of the image is\\nequal to that of the object. The image formed is as far behind the mirror\\nas the object is in front of it. Further, the image is laterally inverted.\\nHow would the images be when the reflecting surfaces are curved? Let\\nus explore.\\nAAAAAccccctttttiiiiivvvvviiiiitttttyyyyy 99999.....11111\\nn Take a large shining spoon. Try to view your face in its curved\\nsurface.\\nn Do you get the image? Is it smaller or larger?\\nn Move the spoon slowly away from your face. Observe the image.\\nHow does it change?\\nn Reverse the spoon and repeat the Activity. How does the image\\nlook like now?\\nn Compare the characteristics of the image on the two surfaces.\\nThe curved surface of a shining spoon could be considered as a curved\\nmirror. The most commonly used type of curved mirror is the spherical\\nmirror. The reflecting surface of such mirrors can be considered to form\\na part of the surface of a sphere. Such mirrors, whose reflecting surfaces\\nare spherical, are called spherical mirrors. We shall now study about\\nspherical mirrors in some detail.\\n99999.....22222 SSSSSPPPPPHHHHHEEEEERRRRRIIIIICCCCCAAAAALLLLL MMMMMIIIIIRRRRRRRRRROOOOORRRRRSSSSS\\nThe reflecting surface of a spherical mirror may be curved inwards or\\noutwards. A spherical mirror, whose reflecting surface is curved inwards,\\nthat is, faces towards the centre of the sphere, is called a concave mirror.\\nA spherical mirror whose reflecting surface is curved outwards, is called\\na convex mirror. The schematic representation of these mirrors is shown\\nin Fig. 9.1. You may note in these diagrams that the back\\nof the mirror is shaded.\\nYou may now understand that the surface of the spoon\\ncurved inwards can be approximated to a concave mirror\\nand the surface of the spoon bulged outwards can be\\napproximated to a convex mirror.\\nBefore we move further on spherical mirrors, we need to\\nrecognise and understand the meaning of a few terms. These\\nterms are commonly used in discussions about spherical (a) Concave mirror (b) Convex mirror\\nmirrors. The centre of the reflecting surface of a spherical\\nFFFFFiiiiiggggguuuuurrrrreeeee 99999.....11111\\nmirror is a point called the pole. It lies on the surface of the Schematic representation of spherical\\nmirror. The pole is usually represented by the letter P. mirrors; the shaded side is non-reflecting.\\nLight – Reflection and Refraction 135\\n2024-25The reflecting surface of a spherical mirror forms a part of a sphere.\\nThis sphere has a centre. This point is called the centre of curvature of\\nthe spherical mirror. It is represented by the letter C. Please note that the\\ncentre of curvature is not a part of the mirror. It lies outside its reflecting\\nsurface. The centre of curvature of a concave mirror lies in front of it.\\nHowever, it lies behind the mirror in case of a convex mirror. You may\\nnote this in Fig.9.2 (a) and (b). The radius of the sphere of which the\\nreflecting surface of a spherical mirror forms a part, is called the radius\\nof curvature of the mirror. It is represented by the letter R. You may note\\nthat the distance PC is equal to the radius of curvature. Imagine a straight\\nline passing through the pole and the centre of curvature of a spherical\\nmirror. This line is called the principal axis. Remember that principal\\naxis is normal to the mirror at its pole. Let us understand an important\\nterm related to mirrors, through an Activity.\\nAAAAAccccctttttiiiiivvvvviiiiitttttyyyyy 99999.....22222\\nCAUTION: Do not look at the Sun directly or even into a mirror\\nreflecting sunlight. It may damage your eyes.\\nn Hold a concave mirror in your hand and direct its reflecting surface\\ntowards the Sun.\\nn Direct the light reflected by the mirror on to a sheet of paper held\\nclose to the mirror.\\nn Move the sheet of paper back and forth gradually until you find\\non the paper sheet a bright, sharp spot of light.\\nn Hold the mirror and the paper in the same position for a few\\nminutes. What do you observe? Why?\\nThe paper at first begins to burn producing smoke. Eventually it\\nmay even catch fire. Why does it burn? The light from the Sun is converged\\nat a point, as a sharp, bright spot by the mirror. In fact, this spot of light\\nis the image of the Sun on the sheet of paper. This point is\\nthe focus of the concave mirror. The heat produced due to\\nthe concentration of sunlight ignites the paper. The distance\\nof this image from the position of the mirror gives the\\napproximate value of focal length of the mirror.\\nLet us try to understand this observation with the help\\nof a ray diagram.\\n(a)\\nObserve Fig.9.2 (a) closely. A number of rays parallel\\nto the principal axis are falling on a concave mirror. Observe\\nthe reflected rays. They are all meeting/intersecting at a\\npoint on the principal axis of the mirror. This point is called\\nthe principal focus of the concave mirror. Similarly, observe\\nFig. 9.2 (b). How are the rays parallel to the principal axis,\\nreflected by a convex mirror? The reflected rays appear to\\ncome from a point on the principal axis. This point is called\\n(b) the principal focus of the convex mirror. The principal focus\\nis represented by the letter F. The distance between the\\nFFFFFiiiiiggggguuuuurrrrreeeee 99999.....22222\\npole and the principal focus of a spherical mirror is called\\n(a) Concave mirror\\n(b) Convex mirror the focal length. It is represented by the letter f.\\n136 Science\\n2024-25The reflecting surface of a spherical mirror is by-and-large spherical.\\nThe surface, then, has a circular outline. The diameter of the reflecting\\nsurface of spherical mirror is called its aperture. In Fig.9.2, distance MN\\nrepresents the aperture. We shall consider in our discussion only such\\nspherical mirrors whose aperture is much smaller than its radius of\\ncurvature.\\nIs there a relationship between the radius of curvature R, and focal\\nlength f, of a spherical mirror? For spherical mirrors of small apertures,\\nthe radius of curvature is found to be equal to twice the focal length. We\\nput this as R = 2f . This implies that the principal focus of a spherical\\nmirror lies midway between the pole and centre of curvature.\\n9.2.1 Image Formation by Spherical Mirrors\\nYou have studied about the image formation by plane mirrors. You also\\nknow the nature, position and relative size of the images formed by them.\\nHow about the images formed by spherical mirrors? How can we locate\\nthe image formed by a concave mirror for different positions of the object?\\nAre the images real or virtual? Are they enlarged, diminished or have\\nthe same size? We shall explore this with an Activity.\\nAAAAAccccctttttiiiiivvvvviiiiitttttyyyyy 99999.....33333\\nYou have already learnt a way of determining the focal length of a\\nconcave mirror. In Activity 9.2, you have seen that the sharp bright\\nspot of light you got on the paper is, in fact, the image of the Sun. It\\nwas a tiny, real, inverted image. You got the approximate focal length\\nof the concave mirror by measuring the distance of the image from\\nthe mirror.\\nn Take a concave mirror. Find out its approximate focal length in\\nthe way described above. Note down the value of focal length. (You\\ncan also find it out by obtaining image of a distant object on a\\nsheet of paper.)\\nn Mark a line on a Table with a chalk. Place the concave mirror on\\na stand. Place the stand over the line such that its pole lies over\\nthe line.\\nn Draw with a chalk two more lines parallel to the previous line\\nsuch that the distance between any two successive lines is equal\\nto the focal length of the mirror. These lines will now correspond\\nto the positions of the points P, F and C, respectively. Remember –\\nFor a spherical mirror of small aperture, the principal focus F lies\\nmid-way between the pole P and the centre of curvature C.\\nn Keep a bright object, say a burning candle, at a position far beyond\\nC. Place a paper screen and move it in front of the mirror till you\\nobtain a sharp bright image of the candle flame on it.\\nn Observe the image carefully. Note down its nature, position and\\nrelative size with respect to the object size.\\nn Repeat the activity by placing the candle – (a) just beyond C,\\n(b) at C, (c) between F and C, (d) at F, and (e) between P and F.\\nn In one of the cases, you may not get the image on the screen.\\nIdentify the position of the object in such a case. Then, look for its\\nvirtual image in the mirror itself.\\nn Note down and tabulate your observations.\\nLight – Reflection and Refraction 137\\n2024-25You will see in the above Activity that the nature, position and size of\\nthe image formed by a concave mirror depends on the position of the\\nobject in relation to points P, F and C. The image formed is real for some\\npositions of the object. It is found to be a virtual image for a certain other\\nposition. The image is either magnified, reduced or has the same size,\\ndepending on the position of the object. A summary of these observations\\nis given for your reference in Table 9.1.\\nTable 9.1 Image formation by a concave mirror for different positions of the object\\nPosition of the Position of the Size of the Nature of the\\nobject image image image\\nAt infinity At the focus F Highly diminished, Real and inverted\\npoint-sized\\nBeyond C Between F and C Diminished Real and inverted\\nAt C At C Same size Real and inverted\\nBetween C and F Beyond C Enlarged Real and inverted\\nAt F At infinity Highly enlarged Real and inverted\\nBetween P and F Behind the mirror Enlarged Virtual and erect\\n9.2.2 Representation of Images Formed by Spherical\\nMirrors Using Ray Diagrams\\nWe can also study the formation of images by spherical mirrors by\\ndrawing ray diagrams. Consider an extended object, of finite size, placed\\nin front of a spherical mirror. Each small portion of the extended object\\nacts like a point source. An infinite number of rays originate from each\\nof these points. To construct the ray diagrams, in order to locate the\\nimage of an object, an arbitrarily large number of rays emanating from a\\npoint could be considered. However, it is more convenient to consider\\nonly two rays, for the sake of clarity of the ray diagram. These rays are\\nso chosen that it is easy to know their directions after reflection from the\\nmirror.\\nThe intersection of at least two reflected rays give the position of image\\nof the point object. Any two of the following rays can be considered for\\nlocating the image.\\n(i) A ray parallel to the principal\\naxis, after reflection, will pass\\nthrough the principal focus\\nin case of a concave mirror\\nor appear to diverge from\\nthe principal focus in\\ncase of a convex mirror.\\nThis is illustrated in Fig.9.3\\n(a) (b)\\n(a) and (b).\\nFFFFFiiiiiggggguuuuurrrrreeeee 99999.....33333\\n138 Science\\n2024-25(ii) A ray passing through the\\nprincipal focus of a concave\\nmirror or a ray which is\\ndirected towards the\\nprincipal focus of a convex\\nmirror, after reflection, will\\nemerge parallel to the\\nprincipal axis. This is\\nillustrated in Fig.9.4 (a)\\nand (b). (a) (b)\\nFFFFFiiiiiggggguuuuurrrrreeeee 99999.....44444\\n(iii) A ray passing through the\\ncentre of curvature of a\\nconcave mirror or directed\\nin the direction of the centre\\nof curvature of a convex\\nmirror, after reflection, is\\nreflected back along the\\nsame path. This is\\nillustrated in Fig.9.5 (a) and\\n(b). The light rays come back\\n(a) (b)\\nalong the same path\\nFFFFFiiiiiggggguuuuurrrrreeeee 99999.....55555\\nbecause the incident rays\\nfall on the mirror along the\\nnormal to the reflecting\\nsurface.\\n(iv) A ray incident obliquely to\\nthe principal axis, towards\\na point P (pole of the mirror),\\non the concave mirror\\n[Fig. 9.6 (a)] or a convex\\nmirror [Fig. 9.6 (b)], is\\nreflected obliquely. The\\nincident and reflected rays\\nfollow the laws of reflection\\n(a) (b)\\nat the point of incidence\\n(point P), making equal FFFFFiiiiiggggguuuuurrrrreeeee 99999.....66666\\nangles with the principal axis.\\nRemember that in all the above cases the laws of reflection are followed.\\nAt the point of incidence, the incident ray is reflected in such a way that\\nthe angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence.\\n(a) Image formation by Concave Mirror\\nFigure 9.7 illustrates the ray diagrams for the formation of image\\nby a concave mirror for various positions of the object.\\nLight – Reflection and Refraction 139\\n2024-25FFFFFiiiiiggggguuuuurrrrreeeee 99999.....77777 Ray diagrams for the image formation by a concave mirror\\nAAAAAccccctttttiiiiivvvvviiiiitttttyyyyy 99999.....44444\\nn Draw neat ray diagrams for each position of the object shown in\\nTable 9.1.\\nn You may take any two of the rays mentioned in the previous section\\nfor locating the image.\\nn Compare your diagram with those given in Fig. 9.7.\\nn Describe the nature, position and relative size of the image formed\\nin each case.\\nn Tabulate the results in a convenient format.\\nUses of concave mirrors\\nConcave mirrors are commonly used in torches, search-lights and\\nvehicles headlights to get powerful parallel beams of light. They are\\noften used as shaving mirrors to see a larger image of the face. The\\ndentists use concave mirrors to see large images of the teeth of patients.\\nLarge concave mirrors are used to concentrate sunlight to produce\\nheat in solar furnaces.\\n(b) Image formation by a Convex Mirror\\nWe studied the image formation by a concave mirror. Now we shall\\nstudy the formation of image by a convex mirror.\\n140 Science\\n2024-25AAAAAccccctttttiiiiivvvvviiiiitttttyyyyy 99999.....55555\\nn Take a convex mirror. Hold it in one hand.\\nn Hold a pencil in the upright position in the other hand.\\nn Observe the image of the pencil in the mirror. Is the image erect or\\ninverted?

State whether the image will move\\ncloser to or farther away from the focus as the object is moved\\naway from the mirror?\\nWe consider two positions of the object for studying the image formed\\nby a convex mirror. First is when the object is at infinity and the second\\nposition is when the object is at a finite distance from the mirror. The ray\\ndiagrams for the formation of image by a convex mirror for these two\\npositions of the object are shown in Fig.9.8 (a) and (b), respectively. The\\nresults are summarised in Table 9.2.\\nFFFFFiiiiiggggguuuuurrrrreeeee 99999.....88888 Formation of image by a convex mirror\\nTable 9.2 Nature, position and relative size of the image formed by a convex mirror\\nPosition of the Position of the Size of the Nature of the\\nobject image image image\\nAt infinity At the focus F, Highly diminished, Virtual and erect\\nbehind the mirror point-sized\\nBetween infinity Between P and F, Diminished Virtual and erect\\nand the pole P of behind the mirror\\nthe mirror\\nYou have so far studied the image formation by a plane mirror, a\\nconcave mirror and a convex mirror.

One such mirror is fitted in a wall of Agra Fort facing Taj\\nMahal. If you visit the Agra Fort, try to observe the full image of Taj\\nMahal. To view distinctly, you should stand suitably at the terrace\\nadjoining the wall.\\nUses of convex mirrors\\nConvex mirrors are commonly used as rear-view (wing) mirrors in\\nvehicles. These mirrors are fitted on the sides of the vehicle, enabling the\\ndriver to see traffic behind him/her to facilitate safe driving. Convex\\nmirrors are preferred because they always give an erect, though\\ndiminished, image. Also, they have a wider field of view as they are curved\\noutwards. Thus, convex mirrors enable the driver to view much larger\\narea than would be possible with a plane mirror.\\nQ U E S T I O N S\\n?\\n1. Define the principal focus of a concave mirror.\\n2.

Why do we prefer a convex mirror as a rear-view mirror in vehicles?\\n9.2.3 Sign Convention for Reflection by Spherical Mirrors\\nWhile dealing with the reflection of light by spherical mirrors, we shall\\nfollow a set of sign conventions called the New Cartesian Sign\\nConvention. In this convention, the pole (P) of the mirror is taken as the\\norigin (Fig. 9.9). The principal axis of the mirror is taken as the x-axis\\n(X’X) of the coordinate system. The conventions are as follows –\\n(i) The object is always placed to the left of the mirror. This implies\\nthat the light from the object falls on the mirror from the left-hand\\nside.\\n(ii) All distances parallel to the principal axis are measured from the\\npole of the mirror.\\n(iii) All the distances measured to the right of the origin (along\\n+ x-axis) are taken as positive while those measured to the left of\\nthe origin (along – x-axis) are taken as negative.\\n(iv) Distances measured perpendicular to and above the principal axis\\n(along + y-axis) are taken as positive.\\n(v) Distances measured perpendicular to and below the principal axis\\n(along –y-axis) are taken as negative.\\n142 Science\\n2024-25The New Cartesian Sign Convention described above is illustrated in\\nFig.9.9 for your reference. These sign conventions are applied to obtain\\nthe mirror formula and solve related numerical problems.\\n9.2.4 Mirror Formula and Magnification\\nIn a spherical mirror, the distance of the\\nobject from its pole is called the object\\ndistance (u). The distance of the image from\\nthe pole of the mirror is called the image\\ndistance (v). You already know that the\\ndistance of the principal focus from the pole\\nis called the focal length (f). There is a\\nrelationship between these three quantities\\ngiven by the mirror formula which is\\nexpressed as\\n1 1 1\\n+ = (9.1)\\nv u f\\nThis formula is valid in all situations for all\\nspherical mirrors for all positions of the\\nobject. You must use the New Cartesian Sign FFFFFiiiiiggggguuuuurrrrreeeee 99999.....99999\\nThe New Cartesian Sign Convention for spherical mirrors\\nConvention while substituting numerical\\nvalues for u, v, f, and R in the mirror formula\\nfor solving problems.\\nMagnification\\nMagnification produced by a spherical mirror gives the relative extent to\\nwhich the image of an object is magnified with respect to the object size.\\nIt is expressed as the ratio of the height of the image to the height of the\\nobject. It is usually represented by the letter m.\\nIf h is the height of the object and h′ is the height of the image, then\\nthe magnification m produced by a spherical mirror is given by\\nHeight of the image (h′)\\nm =\\nHeight of the object (h)\\nh′\\nm = (9.2)\\nh\\nThe magnification m is also related to the object distance (u) and\\nimage distance (v). It can be expressed as:\\nh′ v\\nMagnification (m) = = − (9.3)\\nh u\\nYou may note that the height of the object is taken to be positive as\\nthe object is usually placed above the principal axis. The height of the\\nimage should be taken as positive for virtual images. However, it is to be\\ntaken as negative for real images. A negative sign in the value of the\\nmagnification indicates that the image is real. A positive sign in the value\\nof the magnification indicates that the image is virtual.\\nLight – Reflection and Refraction 143\\n2024-25Example 9.1\\nA convex mirror used for rear-view on an automobile has a radius of\\ncurvature of 3.00 m.

Does it still move along a straight-line path or change its\\ndirection? We shall recall some of our day-to-day experiences.\\nYou might have observed that the bottom of a tank or a pond\\ncontaining water appears to be raised. Similarly, when a thick glass slab\\nis placed over some printed matter, the letters appear raised when viewed\\nthrough the glass slab. Why does it happen? Have you seen a pencil\\npartly immersed in water in a glass tumbler? It appears to be displaced\\nat the interface of air and water.

What happens when a light ray is Refraction of light through a rectangular glass slab\\nincident normally to the interface of two\\nmedia? Try and find out.\\nNow you are familiar with the refraction of light. Refraction is due to\\nchange in the speed of light as it enters from one transparent medium to\\nanother. Experiments show that refraction of light occurs according to\\ncertain laws.\\nLight – Reflection and Refraction 147\\n2024-25The following are the laws of refraction of light.\\n(i) The incident ray, the refracted ray and the normal to the interface\\nof two transparent media at the point of incidence, all lie in the\\nsame plane.\\n(ii) The ratio of sine of angle of incidence to the sine of angle of\\nrefraction is a constant, for the light of a given colour and for\\nthe given pair of media. This law is also known as Snell’s law of\\nrefraction. (This is true for angle 0 < i < 90o)\\nIf i is the angle of incidence and r is the angle of refraction, then,\\nsini\\n= constant (9.4)\\nsinr\\nThis constant value is called the refractive index of the second medium\\nwith respect to the first. Let us study about refractive index in some detail.\\n9.3.2 The Refractive Index\\nYou have already studied that a ray of light that travels obliquely from\\none transparent medium into another will change its direction in the\\nsecond medium. The extent of the change in direction that takes place\\nin a given pair of media may be expressed in terms of the refractive index,\\nthe “constant” appearing on the right-hand side of Eq.(9.4).\\nThe refractive index can be linked to an important physical quantity,\\nthe relative speed of propagation of light in different media. It turns\\nout that light propagates with different speeds in different media. Light\\ntravels fastest in vacuum with speed of 3×108 m s–1. In air, the speed of\\nlight is only marginally less, compared to that in vacuum. It reduces\\nconsiderably in glass or water. The value of the refractive index for a\\ngiven pair of media depends upon the speed of light in the two media, as\\ngiven below.\\nConsider a ray of light travelling from medium 1 into medium 2, as\\nshown in Fig.9.11. Let v be the speed of light in medium 1 and v be the\\n1 2\\nspeed of light in medium 2. The refractive index of medium 2 with respect\\nto medium 1 is given by the ratio of the speed of light in medium 1 and\\nthe speed of light in medium 2. This is usually represented by the symbol\\nn . This can be expressed in an equation form as\\n21\\nSpeed of light in medium 1 v\\nn = = 1 (9.5)\\n21 Speed of light in medium 2 v\\n2\\nBy the same argument, the refractive index of medium\\n1 with respect to medium 2 is represented as n .It is given\\n12\\nby\\nSpeed of light in medium 2 v\\nn = = 2 (9.6)\\nFFFFFiiiiiggggguuuuurrrrreeeee 99999.....1111111111 12 Speed of light in medium 1 v\\n1\\nIf medium 1 is vacuum or air, then the refractive index of medium 2\\nis considered with respect to vacuum. This is called the absolute refractive\\nindex of the medium. It is simply represented as n .

The refractive index of several media is given in Table 9.3. From\\nthe Table you can know that the refractive index of water, n = 1.33.\\nw\\nThis means that the ratio of the speed of light in air and the speed of\\nlight in water is equal to 1.33. Similarly, the refractive index of crown\\nglass, n =1.52. Such data are helpful in many places. However, you\\ng\\nneed not memorise the data.\\nTable 9.3 Absolute refractive index of some material media\\nMaterial Refractive Material Refractive\\nmedium index medium index\\nAir 1.0003 Canada 1.53\\nBalsam\\nIce 1.31\\nWater 1.33 Rock salt 1.54\\nAlcohol 1.36\\nKerosene 1.44 Carbon 1.63\\ndisulphide\\nFused 1.46\\nquartz Dense 1.65\\nflint glass\\nTurpentine 1.47\\noil Ruby 1.71\\nBenzene 1.50\\nSapphire 1.77\\nCrown 1.52\\nglass Diamond 2.42\\nNote from Table 9.3 that an optically denser medium may not possess\\ngreater mass density. For example, kerosene having higher refractive\\nindex, is optically denser than water, although its mass density is less\\nthan water.\\nThe ability of a medium to refract light is also expressed in terms of its optical density.\\nOptical density has a definite connotation. It is not the same as mass density. We have\\nbeen using the terms ‘rarer medium’ and ‘denser medium’ in this Chapter. It actually\\nmeans ‘optically rarer medium’ and ‘optically denser medium’, respectively. When can\\nwe say that a medium is optically denser than the other? In comparing two media, the\\none with the larger refractive index is optically denser medium than the other. The other\\nmedium of lower refractive index is optically rarer. The speed of light is higher in a rarer\\nmedium than a denser medium. Thus, a ray of light travelling from a rarer medium to a\\ndenser medium slows down and bends towards the normal. When it travels from a\\ndenser medium to a rarer medium, it speeds up and bends away from the normal.\\nLight – Reflection and Refraction 149\\n!wonK\\not\\neroM\\n2024-25Q U E S T I O N S\\n1.

The glasses used in spectacles and that by a watchmaker\\nare examples of lenses. What is a lens? How does it bend light rays? We\\nshall discuss these in this section.\\nA transparent material bound by two surfaces, of which one or both\\nsurfaces are spherical, forms a lens. This means\\nthat a lens is bound by at least one spherical\\nsurface. In such lenses, the other surface would\\nbe plane. A lens may have two spherical\\nsurfaces, bulging outwards. Such a lens is called\\na double convex lens. It is simply called a convex\\nlens. It is thicker at the middle as compared to\\nthe edges. Convex lens converges light rays as\\nshown in Fig. 9.12 (a). Hence convex lenses are\\n(a)\\nalso called converging lenses. Similarly, a double\\nconcave lens is bounded by two spherical\\nsurfaces, curved inwards. It is thicker at the\\nedges than at the middle. Such lenses diverge\\nlight rays as shown in Fig. 9.12 (b). Such lenses\\nare also called diverging lenses. A double concave\\nlens is simply called a concave lens.\\nA lens, either a convex lens or a concave lens,\\n(b) has two spherical surfaces.

Since there are two\\ncentres of curvature, we may represent them as C and C . An imaginary\\n1 2\\nstraight line passing through the two centres of curvature of a lens is\\ncalled its principal axis. The central point of a lens is its optical centre. It is\\n150 Science\\n2024-25usually represented by the letter O. A ray of light through the optical\\ncentre of a lens passes without suffering any deviation. The effective\\ndiameter of the circular outline of a spherical lens is called its aperture.\\nWe shall confine our discussion in this Chapter to such lenses whose\\naperture is much less than its radius of curvature and the two centres of\\ncurvatures are equidistant from the optical centre O. Such lenses are\\ncalled thin lenses with small apertures. What happens when parallel rays\\nof light are incident on a lens?

Several rays of light parallel to the\\nprincipal axis are falling on a convex lens. These rays, after refraction\\nfrom the lens, are converging to a point on the principal axis. This point\\non the principal axis is called the principal focus of the lens. Let us see\\nnow the action of a concave lens.\\nObserve Fig.9.12 (b) carefully. Several rays of light parallel to the\\nprincipal axis are falling on a concave lens. These rays, after refraction\\nfrom the lens, are appearing to diverge from a point on the principal\\naxis.

Magnification is represented by the letter m. If h is the\\nheight of the object and h′ is the height of the image given by a lens, then\\nthe magnification produced by the lens is given by,\\nHeight of the Image h′\\nm = = (9.9)\\nHeight of the object h\\nMagnification produced by a lens is also related to the object-distance\\nu, and the image-distance v. This relationship is given by\\nMagnification (m ) = h′/h = v/u (9.10)\\nExample 9.3\\nA concave lens has focal length of 15 cm. At what distance should\\nthe object from the lens be placed so that it forms an image at 10 cm\\nfrom the lens? Also, find the magnification produced by the lens.\\nSolution\\nA concave lens always forms a virtual, erect image on the same side\\nof the object.\\nImage-distance v = –10 cm;\\nFocal length f = –15 cm;\\nObject-distance u = ?\\n1 1 1\\nSince − =\\nv u f\\n1 1 1\\nor, = –\\nu v f\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n= – =– +\\nu –10 (–15) 10 15\\n1 −3+2 1\\n= =\\nu 30 −30\\nor, u = – 30 cm\\nThus, the object-distance is 30 cm.\\nMagnification m = v/u\\n−10cm 1\\nm = = ;+0.33\\n−30cm 3\\nThe positive sign shows that the image is erect and virtual. The image\\nis one-third of the size of the object.\\nExample 9.4\\nA 2.0 cm tall object is placed perpendicular to the principal axis of a\\nconvex lens of focal length 10 cm. The distance of the object from the\\nlens is 15 cm. Find the nature, position and size of the image. Also\\nfind its magnification.\\n156 Science\\n2024-25Solution\\nHeight of the object h = + 2.0 cm;\\nFocal length f = + 10 cm;\\nobject-distance u = –15 cm;\\nImage-distance v = ?\\nHeight of the image h′ = ?\\n1 1 1\\nSince − =\\nv u f\\n1 1 1\\nor, = +\\nv u f\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n= + =− +\\nv (−15) 10 15 10\\n1 −2+3 1\\n= =\\nv 30 30\\nor, v = + 30 cm\\nThe positive sign of v shows that the image is formed at a distance of\\n30 cm on the other side of the optical centre. The image is real and\\ninverted.\\nh' v\\nMagnification m = =\\nh u\\nor, h′ = h (v/u)\\nHeight of the image, h′ = (2.0) (+30/–15) = – 4.0 cm\\nMagnification m = v/u\\n+30cm\\nor, m= =−2\\n−15cm\\nThe negative signs of m and h′ show that the image is inverted and\\nreal. It is formed below the principal axis. Thus, a real, inverted image,\\n4 cm tall, is formed at a distance of 30 cm on the other side of the\\nlens. The image is two times enlarged.\\n9.3.8 Power of a Lens\\nYou have already learnt that the ability of a lens to converge or diverge\\nlight rays depends on its focal length. For example, a convex lens of\\nshort focal length bends the light rays through large angles, by focussing\\nthem closer to the optical centre. Similarly, concave lens of very short\\nfocal length causes higher divergence than the one with longer focal\\nlength. The degree of convergence or divergence of light rays achieved\\nby a lens is expressed in terms of its power. The power of a lens is defined\\nas the reciprocal of its focal length. It is represented by the letter P. The\\npower P of a lens of focal length f is given by\\n1\\nP = (9.11)\\nf\\nLight – Reflection and Refraction 157\\n2024-25The SI unit of power of a lens is ‘dioptre’. It is denoted by the letter D.\\nIf f is expressed in metres, then, power is expressed in dioptres. Thus,\\n1 dioptre is the power of a lens whose focal length is 1 metre. 1D = 1m–1.\\nYou may note that the power of a convex lens is positive and that of a\\nconcave lens is negative.\\nOpticians prescribe corrective lenses indicating their powers. Let us\\nsay the lens prescribed has power equal to + 2.0 D. This means the lens\\nprescribed is convex. The focal length of the lens is + 0.50 m. Similarly,\\na lens of power – 2.5 D has a focal length of – 0.40 m. The lens is concave.\\nMany optical instruments consist of a number of lenses. They are combined to increase\\nthe magnification and sharpness of the image. The net power (P) of the lenses placed\\nin contact is given by the algebraic sum of the individual powers P , P , P , … as\\n1 2 3\\nP = P + P + P + …\\n1 2 3\\nThe use of powers, instead of focal lengths, for lenses is quite convenient for opticians.\\nDuring eye-testing, an optician puts several different combinations of corrective lenses\\nof known power, in contact, inside the testing spectacles’ frame. The optician calculates\\nthe power of the lens required by simple algebraic addition. For example, a combination\\nof two lenses of power + 2.0 D and + 0.25 D is equivalent to a single lens of power + 2.25 D.\\nThe simple additive property of the powers of lenses can be used to design lens systems\\nto minimise certain defects in images produced by a single lens. Such a lens system,\\nconsisting of several lenses, in contact, is commonly used in the design of lenses of\\ncamera, microscopes and telescopes.\\nQ U E S T I O N S\\n?\\n1.
