hydrogen is monovalent. For making models

Addition of halogens to alkenes is an
example of electrophilic addition reaction
involving cyclic halonium ion formation (9.42)
which you will study in higher classes. Markovnikov, a Russian chemist made a
generalisation in 1869 after studying such
reactions in detail. These generalisations
led Markovnikov to frame a rule called
Markovnikov rule. The rule states that
negative part of the addendum (adding
(9.38) molecule) gets attached to that carbon atom
which possesses lesser number of hydrogen
atoms. Thus according to this rule, product
I i.e., 2-bromopropane is expected. In actual
practice, this is the principal product of the
reaction. This generalisation of Markovnikov
(9.39) rule can be better understood in terms of
mechanism of the reaction.

Friedrich August Kekulé,a German chemist was born in 1829 at Darmsdt in
Germany. He became Professor in 1856 and Fellow of Royal Society in 1875. He
made major contribution to structural organic chemistry by proposing in 1858 that
carbon atoms can join to one another to form chains and later in 1865,he found
an answer to the challenging problem of benzene structure by suggesting that
these chains can close to form rings. He gave the dynamic structural formula to
benzene which forms the basis for its modern electronic structure. He described
the discovery of benzene structure later as:

rows,sometimes more closely fitted together; all twisting and turning in snake like motion. But look! What
was that? One of the snakes had seized hold of it’s own tail, and the form whirled mockingly before my
eyes. As if by a flash of lightning I woke;.... I spent the rest of the night working out the consequences of
the hypothesis. Let us learn to dream, gentlemen, and then perhaps we shall learn the truth but let us
beware of making our dreams public before they have been approved by the waking mind.”( 1890).
One hundred years later, on the occasion of Kekulé’s centenary celebrations a group of compounds
having polybenzenoid structures have been named as Kekulenes.
was further found to produce one and only one
monosubstituted derivative which indicated
that all the six carbon and six hydrogen atoms
of benzene are identical. On the basis of this
observation August Kekulé in 1865 proposed
the following structure for benzene having
cyclic arrangement of six carbon atoms with

However, benzene was found to form only

could later on be explained by resonance.
Resonance and stability of benzene
According to Valence Bond Theory, the
concept of oscillating double bonds in benzene
is now explained by resonance. Benzene is a
hybrid of various resonating structures. The
two structures, A and B given by Kekulé are
the main contributing structures. The hybrid
structure is represented by inserting a circle
or a dotted circle in the hexagon as shown
in (C). The circle represents the six electrons
which are delocalised between the six carbon

The six π electrons are thus delocalised
and can move freely about the six carbon
nuclei, instead of any two as shown in
Fig. 9.6 (a) or (b). The delocalised π electron cloud
is attracted more strongly by the nuclei of the
carbon atoms than the electron cloud localised
between two carbon atoms. Therefore, presence
of delocalised π electrons in benzene makes
it more stable than the hypothetical
cyclohexatriene.

Hydrocarbons are the compounds of carbon and hydrogen only. Hydrocarbons are mainly
obtained from coal and petroleum, which are the major sources of energy. Petrochemicals
are the prominent starting materials used for the manufacture of a large number of
commercially important products. LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) and CNG (compressed
natural gas), the main sources of energy for domestic fuels and the automobile industry, are
obtained from petroleum. Hydrocarbons are classified as open chain saturated (alkanes)
and unsaturated (alkenes and alkynes), cyclic (alicyclic) and aromatic, according to their
structure.
The important reactions of alkanes are free radical substitution, combustion, oxidation
and aromatization. Alkenes and alkynes undergo addition reactions, which are mainly
electrophilic additions. Aromatic hydrocarbons, despite having unsaturation, undergo
mainly electrophilic substitution reactions. These undergo addition reactions only under
special conditions.
Alkanes show conformational isomerism due to free rotation along the C–C sigma
bonds. Out of staggered and the eclipsed conformations of ethane, staggered conformation
is more stable as hydrogen atoms are farthest apart. Alkenes exhibit geometrical
(cis-trans) isomerism due to restricted rotation around the carbon–carbon double bond.
benzene and benzenoid compounds show aromatic character. Aromaticity, the
property of being aromatic is possessed by compounds having specific electronic structure
characterised by Hückel (4n+2)π electron rule. The nature of groups or substituents attached
to benzene ring is responsible for activation or deactivation of the benzene ring towards
further electrophilic substitution and also for orientation of the incoming group. Some of
the polynuclear hydrocarbons having fused benzene ring system have carcinogenic property.
