The Paradox of Fractional Oxidation Number
Sometimes, we come across with certain compounds in which the oxidation number of a particular
element in the compound is in fraction. Examples are:
C O [where oxidation number of carbon is (4/3)],
3 2
Br O [where oxidation number of bromine is (16/3)]
3 8
and Na S O (where oxidation number of sulphur is 2.5).
2 4 6
We know that the idea of fractional oxidation number is unconvincing to us, because electrons
are never shared/transferred in fraction. Actually this fractional oxidation state is the average
oxidation state of the element under examination and the structural parameters reveal that the
element for whom fractional oxidation state is realised is present in different oxidation states.
Structure of the species C O , Br O and S O2– reveal the following bonding situations:

+2 0 +2
O = C = C*= C = O
Structure of C O
3 2
(carbon suboxide)
Structure of Br O (tribromooctaoxide) Structure of S O2– (tetrathionate ion)
3 8 4 6
The element marked with asterisk in each species is exhibiting the different oxidation
state (oxidation number) from rest of the atoms of the same element in each of the species.
This reveals that in C O , two carbon atoms are present in +2 oxidation state each, whereas
3 2
the third one is present in zero oxidation state and the average is 4/3. However, the realistic
picture is +2 for two terminal carbons and zero for the middle carbon. Likewise in Br O , each
3 8
of the two terminal bromine atoms are present in +6 oxidation state and the middle bromine
is present in +4 oxidation state. Once again the average, that is different from reality, is
16/3. In the same fashion, in the species S O2–, each of the two extreme sulphurs exhibits oxidation
4 6
state of +5 and the two middle sulphurs as zero. The average of four oxidation numbers of sulphurs
of the S O 2– is 2.5, whereas the reality being + 5,0,0 and +5 oxidation number respectively for
4 6
each sulphur.
We may thus, in general, conclude that the idea of fractional oxidation state should be taken
with care and the reality is revealed by the structures only. Further, whenever we come across
with fractional oxidation state of any particular element in any species, we must understand that
this is the average oxidation number only. In reality (revealed by structures only), the element in
that particular species is present in more than one whole number oxidation states. Fe O , Mn O ,
3 4 3 4
Pb O are some of the other examples of the compounds, which are mixed oxides, where we come
3 4
across with fractional oxidation states of the metal atom. However, the oxidation states may be in
fraction as in O+ and O– where it is +½ and –½ respectively.

SUMMARY
Redox reactions form an important class of reactions in which oxidation and reduction
occur simultaneously. Three tier conceptualisation viz, classical, electronic and oxidation
number, which is usually available in the texts, has been presented in detail. Oxidation,
reduction, oxidising agent (oxidant) and reducing agent (reductant) have been viewed
according to each conceptualisation. Oxidation numbers are assigned in accordance with a
consistent set of rules. Oxidation number and ion-electron method both are useful means in
writing equations for the redox reactions. Redox reactions are classified into four categories:
combination, decomposition displacement and disproportionation reactions. The concept of
redox couple and electrode processes is introduced here. The redox reactions find wide
applications in the study of electrode processes and cells.
