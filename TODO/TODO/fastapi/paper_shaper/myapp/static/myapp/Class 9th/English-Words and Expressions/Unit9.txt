In the play ‘If I Were You’, you have read how Gerrard outsmarts the intruder
with his ‘presence of mind’. The intruder wanted to steal Gerrard’s identity.
In our day-to-day life we share personal information like telephone
number, house address, mobile number, date of birth, e-mail address, etc.,
everyday with people whom we may not know very well.
Don’t you think it is not safe to share information in today’s digital age?
Someone like the intruder in the play ‘If I Were You’ might misuse your
unique and personal identity details. This is called identity theft.
The cases of online identity thefts are increasing day by day. Collect
information about cases of identity theft and share it in the class.

inteRview with a deteCtive
His appearance was clean, cool and deliberately ambiguous.
Under the sanctuary of his aviators, his eyes silently scanned
the room. He is a Manhattan-based, third-generation private
detective who’s been in the business for more than three
decades — specialising in surveillance and being an overall
mystery-tinged badass. We asked him everything we’ve ever
wanted to know about the profession.
2024-25
Unit 9.indd 124 20-02-2023 09:29:55Interviewer : So, what exactly do you do? Notes
Detective : I do a lot of surveillance. Basically,
someone who wonders, “What is this
other person up to?” If it’s insurance
company (surveying someone on
workers’ compensation), they’ll ask, “Is
he back working?” Things like that.
Another very common request is
surveillance: close
locating people, and it could be for a lot
observation, especially of a
of reasons. I had a case recently, a man
suspected spy or criminal
hadn’t been in touch with his mother for
20 years and I helped him find her.
Interviewer : What kind of skills make for a good PI
(Private Investigator)?
Detective : Patience — Number one. You have to
pay attention. You have to be the kind
of person, if you sit in front of a door
watching it for six hours, and you haven’t
seen your guy.
You have to plan accordingly, and be
willing to make sacrifices in order to stay
out there. It’s not a job for people who
want to slack off.
Interviewer : If you needed to locate someone, what’s
the ideal information you need to start?
Detective : Usually, this is what I tell people, “If you
want to find someone, I need the name
with the exact spelling, the DOB if you
DOB: Date of Birth
know it, the social security number,
and a last known, official address where
they’ve lived within the past 15 years.”
Because that means they’ll be in our
database.
Interviewer : Do most private investigators have a
relationship with local police?
Detective : I would say that’s kind of a myth. Most
cops wouldn’t even do it in the first
place, because they know how serious a
violation it is.
Interviewer : Do most private eyes carry guns?
Detective : I don’t think so. We don’t kill people but
help them.

Unit 9.indd 125 20-02-2023 09:29:55Interviewer : What do films and television shows get
wrong about being a PI?
Detective : The big difference is, the things you see
in films do happen to private detectives,
but they’re shrinking down maybe 20
years of adventure into an episode. After
30 years, I probably have one good movie
worth of experiences.

Listen to the story of Shibi Rana and answer the questions
that follow.
There are many stories in our mythology when gods have
disguised themselves in the forms of human beings, birds,
etc. This is done either to test the efficiency and ability of
the kings or to see if people are happy and contented on
earth. This is another aspect of changing the identity. Let us
listen to story of King Shibi.
There was a great king, Shibi Rana who had immense
power then, even gods in heavens were amazed. They feared
that Shibi might take away their kingdoms. They devised a
plan to test his sense of justice. So they decided to reach
Shibi’s kingdom in disguise.
One day, Shibi Rana was sitting on his throne. His
courtroom was surrounded by majestic gardens. There
came a scared dove flying to him and it was followed
by a fierce looking eagle. The king gave shelter to the
dove and saved her. The eagle argued that the king has
taken away his food — the dove. It would starve. The king
magnanimous: generous or
assured the eagle that he would give equal quantity of
forgiving, especially towards
any other food. The eagle asked for King Shibi’s flesh. The
a rival or less powerful
person magnanimous king agreed with a smile. A balance was
brought in the court. It was soon found that with each
addition of the king’s flesh the dove grew heavier. The
equal balance was not arrived at. But the king remained
calm and unperturbed.
The Gods in the guise of dove and eagle were assured of
benevolence: kindness,
Shibi’s righteousness. The forms of the eagle and the dove
generosity and helpfulness
soon disappeared. In their place stood Indra, the king of the
Gods and Agni, the God of fire smiling and blessing the king
for his benevolence and greatness.
