UNIT 1
SOME BASIC CONCEPTS OF CHEMISTRY
Chemistry is the science of molecules and their
transformations. It is the science not so much of the one
hundred elements but of the infinite variety of molecules

This unit is quite large and a chemist often
expresses density in g cm–3, where mass is

Balancing a chemical equation
According to the law of conservation of mass, a balanced chemical equation has the same number of
atoms of each element on both sides of the equation. Many chemical equations can be balanced by
trial and error. Let us take the reactions of a few metals and non-metals with oxygen to give oxides
4 Fe(s) + 3O (g) → 2Fe O (s) (a) balanced equation
2 2 3
2 Mg(s) + O (g) → 2MgO(s) (b) balanced equation
2
P (s) + O (g) → P O (s) (c) unbalanced equation
4 2 4 10
Equations (a) and (b) are balanced, since there are same number of metal and oxygen atoms on
each side of the equations. However equation (c) is not balanced. In this equation, phosphorus
atoms are balanced but not the oxygen atoms. To balance it, we must place the coefficient 5 on
the left of oxygen on the left side of the equation to balance the oxygen atoms appearing on the
right side of the equation.
P (s) + 5O (g) → P O (s) balanced equation
4 2 4 10
Now, let us take combustion of propane, C H . This equation can be balanced in steps.
3 8
Step 1 Write down the correct formulas of reactants and products. Here, propane and oxygen are
reactants, and carbon dioxide and water are products.
C H (g) + O (g) → CO (g) + H O(l) unbalanced equation
3 8 2 2 2
Step 2 Balance the number of C atoms: Since 3 carbon atoms are in the reactant, therefore, three
CO molecules are required on the right side.
2
C H (g) + O (g) → 3CO (g) + H O (l)
3 8 2 2 2
Step 3 Balance the number of H atoms: on the left there are 8 hydrogen atoms in the reactants
however, each molecule of water has two hydrogen atoms, so four molecules of water will be
required for eight hydrogen atoms on the right side.
C H (g) +O (g) → 3CO (g)+4H O (l)
3 8 2 2 2
Step 4 Balance the number of O atoms: There are 10 oxygen atoms on the right side (3 × 2 = 6 in
CO and 4×1= 4 in water). Therefore, five O molecules are needed to supply the required 10 CO
2 2 2
and 4×1= 4 in water). Therefore, five O molecules are needed to supply the required 10 oxygen
2
atoms.
C H (g) +5O (g) → 3CO (g) + 4H O (l)
3 8 2 2 2
Step 5 Verify that the number of atoms of each element is balanced in the final equation. The
equation shows three carbon atoms, eight hydrogen atoms, and 10 oxygen atoms on each side.
All equations that have correct formulas for all reactants and products can be balanced. Always
remember that subscripts in formulas of reactants and products cannot be changed to balance
an equation.

1 M NaOH means 1 mol of NaOH present
in 1 litre of the solution. For 0.2 M solution,

Summary
Chemistry, as we understand it today is not a very old discipline. People in ancient India,
already had the knowledge of many scientific phenomenon much before the advent of
modern science. They applied the knowledge in various walks of life.
The study of chemistry is very important as its domain encompasses every sphere
of life. Chemists study the properties and structure of substances and the changes
undergone by them. All substances contain matter, which can exist in three states –
solid, liquid or gas. The constituent particles are held in different ways in these states
of matter and they exhibit their characteristic properties. Matter can also be classified
into elements, compounds or mixtures. An element contains particles of only one type,
which may be atoms or molecules. The compounds are formed where atoms of two or
more elements combine in a fixed ratio to each other. Mixtures occur widely and many
of the substances present around us are mixtures.
When the properties of a substance are studied, measurement is inherent. The
quantification of properties requires a system of measurement and units in which the
quantities are to be expressed. Many systems of measurement exist, of which the English
2024-25
Unit 1.indd 24 11/30/2022 14:49:36Some BaSic conceptS of chemiStry 25
and the Metric Systems are widely used. The scientific community, however, has agreed to
have a uniform and common system throughout the world, which is abbreviated as SI units
(International System of Units).
Since measurements involve recording of data, which are always associated with a certain
amount of uncertainty, the proper handling of data obtained by measuring the quantities
is very important. The measurements of quantities in chemistry are spread over a wide
range of 10–31 to 10+23. Hence, a convenient system of expressing the numbers in scientific
notation is used. The uncertainty is taken care of by specifying the number of significant
figures, in which the observations are reported. The dimensional analysis helps to express
the measured quantities in different systems of units. Hence, it is possible to interconvert
the results from one system of units to another.
The combination of different atoms is governed by basic laws of chemical combination
— these being the law of conservation of mass, Law of Definite Proportions, Law of
multiple proportions, Gay lussac’s law of Gaseous volumes and avogadro law. All
these laws led to the Dalton’s atomic theory, which states that atoms are building blocks
of matter. The atomic mass of an element is expressed relative to 12C isotope of carbon,
which has an exact value of 12u. Usually, the atomic mass used for an element is the
average atomic mass obtained by taking into account the natural abundance of different
isotopes of that element. The molecular mass of a molecule is obtained by taking sum of
the atomic masses of different atoms present in a molecule. The molecular formula can be
calculated by determining the mass per cent of different elements present in a compound
and its molecular mass.
The number of atoms, molecules or any other particles present in a given system are
expressed in the terms of avogadro constant (6.022 × 1023). This is known as 1 mol of the
respective particles or entities.
Chemical reactions represent the chemical changes undergone by different elements and
compounds. A balanced chemical equation provides a lot of information. The coefficients
indicate the molar ratios and the respective number of particles taking part in a particular
reaction. The quantitative study of the reactants required or the products formed is called
stoichiometry. Using stoichiometric calculations, the amount of one or more reactant(s)
required to produce a particular amount of product can be determined and vice-versa. The
amount of substance present in a given volume of a solution is expressed in number of ways,
e.g., mass per cent, mole fraction, molarity and molality.
