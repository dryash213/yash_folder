Dynamic Equilibrium – A Student’s Activity
Equilibrium whether in a physical or in a chemical system, is always of dynamic nature. This can
be demonstrated by the use of radioactive isotopes. This is not feasible in a school laboratory.
However this concept can be easily comprehended by performing the following activity. The activity
can be performed in a group of 5 or 6 students.
Take two 100mL measuring cylinders (marked as 1 and 2) and two glass tubes each of
30 cm length. Diameter of the tubes may be same or different in the range of 3-5mm. Fill
nearly half of the measuring cylinder-1 with coloured water (for this purpose add a crystal
of potassium permanganate to water) and keep second cylinder (number 2) empty.
Put one tube in cylinder 1 and second in cylinder 2. Immerse one tube in cylinder 1,
close its upper tip with a finger and transfer the coloured water contained in its lower portion to
cylinder 2. Using second tube, kept in 2nd cylinder, transfer the coloured water in a similar manner
from cylinder 2 to cylinder 1. In this way keep on transferring coloured water using the two glass
tubes from cylinder 1 to 2 and from 2 to 1 till you notice that the level of coloured water in both
the cylinders becomes constant.
If you continue intertransferring coloured solution between the cylinders, there will not be
any further change in the levels of coloured water in two cylinders. If we take analogy of ‘level’ of
coloured water with ‘concentration’ of reactants and products in the two cylinders, we can say
the process of transfer, which continues even after the constancy of level, is indicative of dynamic
nature of the process. If we repeat the experiment taking two tubes of different diameters we find
that at equilibrium the level of coloured water in two cylinders is different. How far diameters are
responsible for change in levels in two cylinders? Empty cylinder (2) is an indicator of no product
in it at the beginning.

Le Chatelier’s principle. It states that a
change in any of the factors that determine
the equilibrium conditions of a system
will cause the system to change in such a
manner so as to reduce or to counteract
the effect of the change. This is applicable
to all physical and chemical equilibria.
We shall now be discussing factors which
can influence the equilibrium.

Faraday was born near London into a family of very limited means. At the age of
14 he was an apprentice to a kind bookbinder who allowed Faraday to read the
books he was binding. Through a fortunate chance he became laboratory assistant
to Davy, and during 1813-4, Faraday accompanied him to the Continent. During
this trip he gained much from the experience of coming into contact with many of the
leading scientists of the time. In 1825, he succeeded Davy as Director of the Royal
Institution laboratories, and in 1833 he also became the first Fullerian Professor of
Chemistry. Faraday’s first important work was on analytical chemistry. After 1821

phenomena. His ideas have led to the establishment of modern field theory.
He discovered his two laws of electrolysis in 1834. Faraday was a very modest and kind hearted
person. He declined all honours and avoided scientific controversies. He preferred to work alone and
never had any assistant. He disseminated science in a variety of ways including his Friday evening
discourses, which he founded at the Royal Institution. He has been very famous for his Christmas
lecture on the ‘Chemical History of a Candle’. He published nearly 450 scientific papers.

Arrhenius was born near Uppsala, Sweden. He presented his thesis, on the
conductivities of electrolyte solutions, to the University of Uppsala in 1884. For the
next five years he travelled extensively and visited a number of research centers
in Europe. In 1895 he was appointed professor of physics at the newly formed
University of Stockholm, serving its rector from 1897 to 1902. From 1905 until his
death he was Director of physical chemistry at the Nobel Institute in Stockholm. He
continued to work for many years on electrolytic solutions. In 1899 he discussed
the temperature dependence of reaction rates on the basis of an equation, now
usually known as Arrhenius equation.
He worked in a variety of fields, and made important contributions to

When the number of molecules leaving the liquid to vapour equals the number of molecules
returning to the liquid from vapour, equilibrium is said to be attained and is dynamic in
nature. Equilibrium can be established for both physical and chemical processes and at

Equilibrium constant has constant value at a fixed temperature and at this stage all the
macroscopic properties such as concentration, pressure, etc. become constant. For a gaseous

the change in any factor such as temperature, pressure, concentration, etc. will cause the
equilibrium to shift in such a direction so as to reduce or counteract the effect of the change.
It can be used to study the effect of various factors such as temperature, concentration,
pressure, catalyst and inert gases on the direction of equilibrium and to control the yield of
products by controlling these factors. Catalyst does not effect the equilibrium composition
of a reaction mixture but increases the rate of chemical reaction by making available a new
lower energy pathway for conversion of reactants to products and vice-versa.
All substances that conduct electricity in aqueous solutions are called electrolytes. Acids,
bases and salts are electrolytes and the conduction of electricity by their aqueous solutions
is due to anions and cations produced by the dissociation or ionization of electrolytes
in aqueous solution. The strong electrolytes are completely dissociated. In weak electrolytes
there is equilibrium between the ions and the unionized electrolyte molecules. According to
Arrhenius, acids give hydrogen ions while bases produce hydroxyl ions in their aqueous
solutions. brönsted-lowry on the other hand, defined an acid as a proton donor and a base as
a proton acceptor. When a Brönsted-Lowry acid reacts with a base, it produces its conjugate
base and a conjugate acid corresponding to the base with which it reacts. Thus a conjugate
pair of acid-base differs only by one proton. lewis further generalised the definition of an
acid as an electron pair acceptor and a base as an electron pair donor. The expressions

of the salt is established. The conditions of precipitation of the salt from their solutions
or their dissolution in water are worked out. The role of common ion and the solubility of
