11. Law of inertia : An object remains in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line until and
unless acted upon by an external unbalanced force . I

When a moving bus stops suddenly, the bus slows down but our body tends to remain in state of
motion due to inertia of motion, Hence we get a forward jerk. |

Sudden start of the bus brings motion to the bus as well as our feet but the rest of the body still has inertia of
