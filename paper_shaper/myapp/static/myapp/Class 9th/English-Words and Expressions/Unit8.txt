and Kathmandu to India. Vikram Seth beautifully describes the natural
landscape, cultural richness and diversity among people from region to
region.
Do you know?
A river in New Zealand has become the first in the world
to be recognised as a living entity with the legal status of a
person after a 170-year battle by the local Maori people.
The nation’s parliament passed a bill to allow Whanganui
River— known by the Maoris as Te Awa Tupua— to represent
its own interests and advocate on its own behalf.
This is a unique judgement for sustaining the health and
well-being of the river.

Read the following passage and answer the questions that
follow.
Text I
When we think of tourism, we think primarily of people who
are visiting a particular place for sightseeing, visiting friends
and relatives, taking a vacation, and having a good time. They
may spend their leisure time engaging in various sports,
sunbathing, talking, singing, taking rides, touring, reading
or simply enjoying further. We may include in our definition
of tourism people who are participating in a convention,
a business conference, or some other kind of business or
professional activity. Those who are taking a study tour under
an expert guide or doing some kind of scientific research or
study are also doing tourism. These visitors use all forms of
transportation from hiking in a wilderness park to flying in chairlift: a series of chairs
hanging from a moving
a jet to an exciting city. Transportation can include taking a
cable, for carrying people up
chairlift up a Colorado mountainside or standing at the rail
and down a mountain
of a cruise ship looking across the blue Caribbean. Whether
people travel by one of these means or by car, motor coach
camper, train, motorbike or bicycle, they are taking a trip
and thus are engaging in tourism.

Charles R. Goeldner and J.R. Brent Ritchie, p. 4)

and confusion. The pier was crowded with carriages and
in the sea and joined to the
men; passengers were arriving and hurrying on board;
land at one end
the vessel’s decks were encumbered with trunks and
woebegone: very sad or valises; groups of excursionists, arrayed in unattractive
miserable traveling costumes, were moping about in a drizzling
rain and looking as droopy and woebegone as so many
molting chickens. The gallant flag was up, but it was
under the spell, too, and hung limp and disheartened by
the mast. Altogether, it was the bluest, bluest spectacle!

A Visit to Bhitarkanika
The sun was warm but the sea breeze kept up its cooling
effect all along. Soon the steamer turned away and anchored
creek: a narrow area of water
near a creek by the river. The muddy fringe and the mangrove
where the sea flows into the
vegetation declared the gateway to the Bhitarkanika Wildlife
land
Sanctuary in Odisha. The steamer could not negotiate these
creeks at low tide, so a similar motorboat was hired to ferry
us to the Dangmal forest rest-house in the heart of the
mangrove forest. From the motorboat we had a good look at
a large crocodile basking in the sun.
The boat moved on, taking us deeper into the forest.
Here we felt as though we had stepped into a time warp. In plumage: the feathers
covering a bird’s body
this awesome and mysterious place, birds of extraordinary
plumage appeared before us. For the moment we revelled
in the magnificence of nature which had us completely in
its thrall. Among the birds, the kingfishers were the stars of
the show. Crocodiles, large and small, slid into the water at
our approach. Through the foliage we could see chital deer
delicately browsing on fresh outcrops of leaves.
A herd of wild boar was spotted searching for succulent
brooding silence: mysterious
roots. High above us, open-billed storks stood sentry-like
silence
following our progress through their remarkable kingdom.
The evening sun was beginning to paint the tree-lined horizon
crimson and gold and a brooding silence enveloped us all.

and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts.
Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things
