Role of musiC in life
Today, we are rushing through life and everyone seems to
be pressurised and stressed about one or the other thing.
inescapable: unable to be Stress has become an inescapable part of our lives. Many
avoided or denied
of our illnesses are a result of stress, and to deal with it, we
need certain ways to relax our body and mind. Listening to
music, particularly gentle, calming and melodious music,
relaxes people both physically and mentally. Music releases
endorphins, the natural painkillers in our brain,
which relieve us from the sense of pain. Music
can normalise heart rate and blood pressure.
The common occurrences of fatigue and boredom
decrease when we listen to music. It diverts
our attention from everyday anxieties, thereby
reducing the stress caused by such concerns.
While meditating, listening to music helps us to
connect with our soul. Students can improve their
concentration and boost their memory by listening
to soft music. Soothing music, when played at
night, helps us to rest and relax for a good night’s
sleep. Listening to good music helps in overcoming
negative traits such as anger or worry, thereby
improving our personality. It creates positive
energy and happiness. Every cell in the body
becomes energetic with increased peace of mind.
Music is a therapy for everyone — plants,
birds, animals and human beings — to flourish
and rejuvenate. It certainly plays an important
part in making the world better for all living beings.

Beating the odds
The musical accomplishments of composer Ludwig van
Beethoven have been all the more remarkable for the
fact that he lost his hearing ability from an early age. He
beating the odds: to succeed
developed the symptoms of tinnitus, a constant sound of
despite not having a good
chance of succeeding ringing in his ears that made it difficult for him to hear. He
is compared to Mozart for his genius, and is considered the
most eminent musician after Mozart.
Although his formal education never went beyond the
elementary level, he trained in music under Joseph Haydn.
He has always been acclaimed as a brilliant piano maestro.
His father and grandfather were the court musicians of a
German prince. Young Ludwig was often made to perform for
his father’s drinking companions in the middle of the night,
and was even beaten if he protested.
For the first thirty years of his life, Beethoven could listen
to and play music effortlessly. As a result, he understood
sounds of musical instruments and the pitch of the singing
voices. He knew the harmony between music and singing
before he became completely deaf. His deafness was not
sudden, but a gradual decline. This slow process of losing his
hearing activated his mind to imagine
how his compositions would sound
like. When he became completely deaf,
he started to observe the vibrations of
the piano. The observations helped him
realise that he could not hear the high
notes of the piano. To be able to hear
his own compositions, he sawed off the
legs of his piano. The piano touched
the floor, and Beethoven would press
his ear to the floor, banging the piano
keys to listen to the high notes in his
compositions.
The most significant aspect of
Beethoven’s character was that he
did not give up. With a brave heart,
he confronted the greatest challenge

achieving the pinnacle of musical success. He fought against
the greatest obstacle and won.
His quality of ‘never giving up’ strengthened him. It
made him come to terms with his deafness in a dynamic
and constructive way. These qualities led him to become a
famous composer.

listening
A passage on the healing aspect of music is given below.
You need to listen to the passage read by your teacher/
classmate carefully and answer the question that follows.
You may listen to the passage twice, if required.
musiC as a theRapy
“Rhythm and harmony find their way into the inward places
of the soul”, rightly said by Plato. Music is often referred
to as ‘food’ for the soul due to the several benefits we can
derive from experiencing it.
Music can be pleasure for some, and a way to relax
for others. It also motivates and energises listeners. Music
is, indeed, a universal language, which can bring nations
together and unite people with different faiths as it touches
one’s soul. In the mainstream, music is mainly known for
its entertainment quotient, but the Indian culture also talks
about the healing effects of music through ‘Raga Chikitsa’.
Raga Chikitsa has helped in reviving an ancient healing
practice known as Nada Yoga.
Nada is a musical sound, which is believed to have
curative effects on the body and soul of all creatures.
Consequently, its power is therapeutic and is used in curing
diseases. Medical research has found music therapy to aid
patients in pain management. It is not surprising, as music
affects the body and mind significantly.

is said that listening to soft, sedative music once a day can
help overcome depression.
Music therapy finds its traces in mythology. The story of
Hippocrates, the Greek father of medicine dates back to 400
B.C. He is known to have used music to cure his patients.
This therapy also aids stroke victims to heal at a faster
rate, since it increases the patient’s emotional comforts and
motivates them to move towards the path of recovery. On
the other hand, adolescents, too, are benefitted by music
in terms of emotional, social and psychological well being.
Music is a force that purifies beings from within.
According to you, which FOUR of the following statements
are true?
(a) Nada Yoga treats diseases through Raga Chikitsa.
(b) Music is a universal language that reaches souls.
(c) Music therapy dates back to 400 B.C.
(d) Hippocrates played music to treat the patients.
(e) Upbeat tunes help stroke victims recover faster.
(f) Music helps adolescents to discover their identity.
speaking
Two students need to come to the front of the class for a role
play. One plays the role of Thyagaraja, a famous singer, and
the other the role of the interviewer, Rohit, a Radio Jockey (RJ).
The interview is about the singer’s initiatives in helping
people through music.
RJ Rohit : Do you think music has any effect on
people’s lives?
Thyagaraja : Yes, I believe music surely has a
positive effect on people’s lives. It helps
when you are stressed, or depressed
about something. Apart from these,
music is a good way of relaxing and
feeling good about life.
RJ Rohit : What, according to you, could be the
influence of music on young children?

Thyagaraja : Listening to music relaxes patients. The

they are in a relaxed state of mind.
