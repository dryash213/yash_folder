MOVING CHARGES
AND MAGNETISM
4.1 I
NTRODUCTION
Both Electricity and Magnetism have been known for more than 2000
years. However, it was only about 200 years ago, in 1820, that it was
realised that they were intimately related. During a lecture demonstration
in the summer of 1820, Danish physicist Hans Christian Oersted noticed
that a current in a straight wire caused a noticeable deflection in a nearby
magnetic compass needle. He investigated this phenomenon. He found
that the alignment of the needle is tangential to an imaginary circle which
has the straight wire as its centre and has its plane perpendicular to the
wire. This situation is depicted in Fig.4.1(a). It is noticeable when the
current is large and the needle sufficiently close to the wire so that the
earth’s magnetic field may be ignored. Reversing the direction of the
current reverses the orientation of the needle [Fig. 4.1(b)]. The deflection
increases on increasing the current or bringing the needle closer to the
wire. Iron filings sprinkled around the wire arrange themselves in
concentric circles with the wire as the centre [Fig. 4.1(c)]. Oersted
concluded that moving charges or currents produced a magnetic field
in the surrounding space.
Following this, there was intense experimentation. In 1864, the laws
obeyed by electricity and magnetism were unified and formulated by

James Maxwell who then realised that light was electromagnetic waves.
Radio waves were discovered by Hertz, and produced by J.C.Bose and
G. Marconi by the end of the 19th century. A remarkable scientific and
technological progress took place in the 20th century. This was due to
our increased understanding of electromagnetism and the invention of
devices for production, amplification, transmission and detection of
electromagnetic waves.
FIGURE 4.1 The magnetic field due to a straight long current-carrying
wire. The wire is perpendicular to the plane of the paper. A ring of
compass needles surrounds the wire. The orientation of the needles is
shown when (a) the current emerges out of the plane of the paper,
(b) the current moves into the plane of the paper. (c) The arrangement of
iron filings around the wire. The darkened ends of the needle represent
north poles. The effect of the earth’s magnetic field is neglected.
In this chapter, we will see how magnetic field exerts
forces on moving charged particles, like electrons, protons,
and current-carrying wires. We shall also learn how
currents produce magnetic fields. We shall see how
particles can be accelerated to very high energies in a
cyclotron. We shall study how currents and voltages are
detected by a galvanometer.
In this and subsequent Chapter on magnetism,
we adopt the following convention: A current or a
field (electric or magnetic) emerging out of the plane of the

paper is depicted by a dot ( ). A current or a field going
into the plane of the paper is depicted by a cross ()*.

where rˆ is unit vector along r, and the field E is a vector
field. A charge q interacts with this field and experiences
a force F given by
F = q E = q Q rˆ / (4pe) r2 (4.2)
0
As pointed out in the Chapter 1, the field E is not just
an artefact but has a physical role. It can convey energy
and momentum and is not established instantaneously
but takes finite time to propagate. The concept of a field
was specially stressed by Faraday and was incorporated
by Maxwell in his unification of electricity and magnetism.
In addition to depending on each point in space, it can
also vary with time, i.e., be a function of time. In our
discussions in this chapter, we will assume that the fields
do not change with time.
The field at a particular point can be due to one or
more charges. If there are more charges the fields add
vectorially. You have already learnt in Chapter 1 that this
is called the principle of superposition. Once the field is
known, the force on a test charge is given by Eq. (4.2).
Just as static charges produce an electric field, the
currents or moving charges produce (in addition) a
magnetic field, denoted by B (r), again a vector field. It
has several basic properties identical to the electric field.
It is defined at each point in space (and can in addition
depend on time). Experimentally, it is found to obey the
principle of superposition: the magnetic field of several
sources is the vector addition of magnetic field of each
individual source.
4.2.2 Magnetic Field, Lorentz Force
Let us suppose that there is a point charge q (moving
with a velocity v and, located at r at a given time t) in
presence of both the electric field E (r) and the magnetic
field B (r). The force on an electric charge q due to both
of them can be written as
F = q [ E (r) + v × B (r)] ” F +F (4.3)
electric magnetic
This force was given first by H.A. Lorentz based on the extensive
experiments of Ampere and others. It is called the Lorentz force. You
have already studied in detail the force due to the electric field. If we
look at the interaction with the magnetic field, we find the following
features.
(i) It depends on q, v and B (charge of the particle, the velocity and the
magnetic field). Force on a negative charge is opposite to that on a
positive charge.
(ii) The magnetic force q [ v × B ] includes a vector product of velocity

and magnetic field. The vector product makes the force due to magnetic

or anti-parallel. The force acts in a (sideways) direction perpendicular
to both the velocity and the magnetic field. Its
direction is given by the screw rule or right hand

Dimensionally, we have [B] = [F/qv] and the unit
of B are Newton second / (coulomb metre). This unit is called tesla (T)
named after Nikola Tesla (1856 – 1943). Tesla is a rather large unit. A
smaller unit (non-SI) called gauss (=10–4 tesla) is also often used. The
earth’s magnetic field is about 3.6 × 10–5 T.
4.2.3 Magnetic force on a current-carrying conductor
We can extend the analysis for force due to magnetic field on a single
moving charge to a straight rod carrying current. Consider a rod of a
uniform cross-sectional area A and length l. We shall assume one kind
of mobile carriers as in a conductor (here electrons). Let the number
density of these mobile charge carriers in it be n. Then the total number
of mobile charge carriers in it is nlA. For a steady current I in this
conducting rod, we may assume that each mobile carrier has an average
drift velocity v (see Chapter 3). In the presence of an external magnetic
d
field B, the force on these carriers is:
F = (nlA)q v ····· B
d
where q is the value of the charge on a carrier. Now nq v is the current
d
density j and |(nq v )|A is the current I (see Chapter 3 for the discussion
d
of current and current density). Thus,
F = [(nq v )lA] × B = [ jAl ] ····· B
d
= Il ····· B (4.4)
where l is a vector of magnitude l, the length of the rod, and with a direction
identical to the current I. Note that the current I is not a vector. In the last
step leading to Eq. (4.4), we have transferred the vector sign from j to l.
Equation (4.4) holds for a straight rod. In this equation, B is the
external magnetic field. It is not the field produced by the current-carrying
rod. If the wire has an arbitrary shape we can calculate the Lorentz force
on it by considering it as a collection of linear strips dl and summing

Note that it would have been sufficient to specify m/l, the mass per

4 × 10–5 T and we have ignored it.
Example 4.2 If the magnetic field is parallel to the positive y-axis
and the charged particle is moving along the positive x-axis (Fig. 4.4),
which way would the Lorentz force be for (a) an electron (negative
charge), (b) a proton (positive charge).
FIGURE 4.4
Solution The velocity v of particle is along the x-axis, while B, the
magnetic field is along the y-axis, so v × B is along the z-axis (screw
rule or right-hand thumb rule). So, (a) for electron it will be along –z
axis. (b) for a positive charge (proton) the force is along +z axis.

OTION IN A AGNETIC IELD
We will now consider, in greater detail, the motion of a charge moving in
a magnetic field. We have learnt in Mechanics (see Class XI book, Chapter
6) that a force on a particle does work if the force has a component along
(or opposed to) the direction of motion of the particle. In the case of motion
of a charge in a magnetic field, the magnetic force is perpendicular to the
velocity of the particle. So no work is done and no change in the magnitude
of the velocity is produced (though the direction of momentum may be
changed). [Notice that this is unlike the force due to an electric field, qE,
which can have a component parallel (or antiparallel) to motion and thus
can transfer energy in addition to momentum.]
We shall consider motion of a charged particle in a uniform magnetic
field. First consider the case of v perpendicular to B. The
perpendicular force, q v × B, acts as a centripetal force and
produces a circular motion perpendicular to the magnetic field.
The particle will describe a circle if v and B are perpendicular
to each other (Fig. 4.5).
If velocity has a component along B, this component
remains unchanged as the motion along the magnetic field will
not be affected by the magnetic field. The motion in a plane
perpendicular to B is as before a circular one, thereby producing
a helical motion (Fig. 4.6).
You have already learnt in earlier classes (See Class XI,
Chapter 4) that if r is the radius of the circular path of a particle,
then a force of m v2 / r, acts perpendicular to the path towards
the centre of the circle, and is called the centripetal force. If the
FIGURE 4.5 Circular motion velocity v is perpendicular to the magnetic field B, the magnetic
force is perpendicular to both v and B and acts
like a centripetal force. It has a magnitude q v
B. Equating the two expressions for centripetal
force,
m v 2/r = q v B, which gives
r = m v / qB (4.5)
for the radius of the circle described by the
charged particle. The larger the momentum, the
larger is the radius and bigger the circle
described. If w is the angular frequency, then v
= w r. So,
w = 2p n = q B/ m [4.6(a)]
which is independent of the velocity or energy .
Here n is the frequency of rotation. The
independence of n from energy has important
application in the design of a cyclotron (see
Section 4.4.2).
The time taken for one revolution is T= 2p/w

(Fig. 4.6). The distance moved along the magnetic field in one rotation is
called pitch p. Using Eq. [4.6 (a)], we have

The radius of the circular component of motion is called the radius of
the helix.

9 × 10-31 kg and charge 1.6 × 10–19 C) moving at a speed of 3 ×107 m/s in
a magnetic field of 6 × 10–4 T perpendicular to it? What is its
frequency? Calculate its energy in keV. ( 1 eV = 1.6 × 10–19 J).
Solution Using Eq. (4.5) we find
r = m v / (qB) = 9 ×10–31 kg × 3 × 107 m s–1 / ( 1.6 × 10–19 C × 6 × 10–4 T)

All magnetic fields that we know are due to currents (or moving
charges) and due to intrinsic magnetic moments of particles.
Here, we shall study the relation between current and the
magnetic field it produces. It is given by the Biot-Savart’s law.
Fig. 4.7 shows a finite conductor XY carrying current I. Consider
an infinitesimal element dl of the conductor. The magnetic field
dB due to this element is to be determined at a point P which is at
a distance r from it. Let q be the angle between dl and the
displacement vector r. According to Biot-Savart’s law, the
magnitude of the magnetic field dB is proportional to the current
I, the element length |dl|, and inversely proportional to the square
of the distance r. Its direction* is perpendicular to the plane
containing dl and r. Thus, in vector notation,

The Biot-Savart law for the magnetic field has certain similarities, as
well as, differences with the Coulomb’s law for the electrostatic field. Some
of these are:
(i) Both are long range, since both depend inversely on the square of
distance from the source to the point of interest. The principle of
superposition applies to both fields. [In this connection, note that
the magnetic field is linear in the source I dl just as the electrostatic
field is linear in its source: the electric charge.]
(ii) The electrostatic field is produced by a scalar source, namely, the electric
charge. The magnetic field is produced by a vector source I dl.
(iii)The electrostatic field is along the displacement vector joining the
source and the field point. The magnetic field is perpendicular to the
plane containing the displacement vector rand the current element I dl.
(iv) There is an angle dependence in the Biot-Savart law which is not
present in the electrostatic case. In Fig. 4.7, the magnetic field at any
point in the direction of dl (the dashed line) is zero. Along this line,
q = 0, sin q = 0 and from Eq. [4.11(a)], |dB| = 0.
There is an interesting relation between e, the permittivity of free

In this section, we shall evaluate the magnetic field due
to a circular coil along its axis. The evaluation entails
summing up the effect of infinitesimal current elements
(I dl) mentioned in the previous section. We assume
that the current I is steady and that the evaluation is
carried out in free space (i.e., vacuum).
Fig. 4.9 depicts a circular loop carrying a steady

centre at the origin O and has a radius R. The x-axis is
the axis of the loop. We wish to calculate the magnetic
field at the point P on this axis. Let x be the distance of
P from the centre O of the loop.
Consider a conducting element dl of the loop. This is

the x-axis are summed over, they cancel out and we obtain a null result.
For example, the dB component due to dl is cancelled by the contribution

to B from the semicircle differs from that of a circular loop and in
what way does it resemble? (c) Would your answer be different if the

opposite way as shown in Fig. 4.11(b)?
FIGURE 4.11
Solution
(a) dl and r for each element of the straight segments are parallel.
Therefore, dl × r = 0. Straight segments do not contribute to
|B|.
(b) For all segments of the semicircular arc, dl × r are all parallel to
each other (into the plane of the paper). All such contributions
add up in magnitude. Hence direction of B for a semicircular arc
is given by the right-hand rule and magnitude is half that of a

MPERE S IRCUITAL AW
There is an alternative and appealing way in which the
Biot-Savart law may be expressed. Ampere’s circuital law
considers an open surface with a boundary (Fig. 4.14).
The surface has current passing through it. We consider
the boundary to be made up of a number of small line
elements. Consider one such element of length dl. We
take the value of the tangential component of the
magnetic field, B,at this element and multiply it by the FIGURE 4.12

length of that element dl [Note: Bdl=B.dl]. All such
t
products are added together. We consider the limit as the
lengths of elements get smaller and their number gets
larger. The sum then tends to an integral. Ampere’s law
states that this integral is equal to m times the total
0
current passing through the surface, i.e.,
“
B.dl = mI [4.17(a)]
0
where I is the total current through the surface. The
integral is taken over the closed loop coinciding with the
boundary C of the surface. The relation above involves a
sign-convention, given by the right-hand rule. Let the
fingers of the right-hand be curled in the sense the
“
boundary is traversed in the loop integral B.dl. Then
the direction of the thumb gives the sense in which the
current I is regarded as positive.
For several applications, a much simplified version of
Eq. [4.17(a)] proves sufficient. We shall assume that, in
such cases, it is possible to choose the loop (called
an amperian loop) such that at each point of the
loop, either
(i) B is tangential to the loop and is a non-zero constant
B, or
(ii) B is normal to the loop, or
(iii) B vanishes.
Now, let L be the length (part) of the loop for which B
is tangential. Let I be the current enclosed by the loop.
e
Then, Eq. (4.17) reduces to,
BL =mI [4.17(b)]
0 e
When there is a system with a symmetry such as for
a straight infinite current-carrying wire in Fig. 4.13, the
Ampere’s law enables an easy evaluation of the magnetic
field, much the same way Gauss’ law helps in
determination of the electric field. This is exhibited in the
Example 4.9 below. The boundary of the loop chosen is
a circle and magnetic field is tangential to the
circumference of the circle. The law gives, for the left hand

Andre Ampere (1775 –
1836) Andre Marie Ampere
was a French physicist,
mathematician and chemist
who founded the science of
electrodynamics. Ampere
was a child prodigy
who mastered advanced
mathematics by the age of
12. Ampere grasped the
significance of Oersted’s
discovery. He carried out a
large series of experiments
to explore the relationship
between current electricity
and magnetism. These
investigations culminated
in 1827 with the
publication of the
‘Mathematical Theory of
Electrodynamic Pheno-
mena Deduced Solely from
Experiments’. He hypo-
thesised that all magnetic
phenomena are due to
circulating electric
currents. Ampere was
humble and absent-
minded. He once forgot an
invitation to dine with the
Emperor Napoleon. He died
of pneumonia at the age of
61. His gravestone bears
the epitaph: Tandem Felix
(Happy at last).
(i) It implies that the field at every point on a circle of
radius r, (with the wire along the axis), is same in
magnitude. In other words, the magnetic field

possesses what is called a cylindrical symmetry. The field that
normally can depend on three coordinates depends only on one: r.
Whenever there is symmetry, the solutions simplify.
(ii) The field direction at any point on this circle is tangential to it.
Thus, the lines of constant magnitude of magnetic field form
concentric circles. Notice now, in Fig. 4.1(c), the iron filings form
concentric circles. These lines called magnetic field lines form closed
loops. This is unlike the electrostatic field lines which originate
from positive charges and end at negative charges. The expression
for the magnetic field of a straight wire provides a theoretical
justification to Oersted’s experiments.
(iii) Another interesting point to note is that even though the wire is
infinite, the field due to it at a non-zero distance is not infinite. It
tends to blow up only when we come very close to the wire. The
field is directly proportional to the current and inversely
proportional to the distance from the (infinitely long) current source.
(iv) There exists a simple rule to determine the direction of the magnetic
field due to a long wire. This rule, called the right-hand rule*, is:
Grasp the wire in your right hand with your extended thumb pointing
in the direction of the current. Your fingers will curl around in the
direction of the magnetic field.
Ampere’s circuital law is not new in content from Biot-Savart law.
Both relate the magnetic field and the current, and both express the same
physical consequences of a steady electrical current. Ampere’s law is to
Biot-Savart law, what Gauss’s law is to Coulomb’s law. Both, Ampere’s
and Gauss’s law relate a physical quantity on the periphery or boundary
(magnetic or electric field) to another physical quantity, namely, the source,
in the interior (current or charge). We also note that Ampere’s circuital
law holds for steady currents which do not fluctuate with time. The
following example will help us understand what is meant by the term
enclosed current.
Example 4.8 Figure 4.13 shows a long straight wire of a circular
cross-section (radius a) carrying steady current I. The current I is
uniformly distributed across this cross-section. Calculate the
magnetic field in the region r < a and r > a.

* Note that there are two distinct right-hand rules: One which gives the direction
of B on the axis of current-loop and the other which gives direction of B
for a straight conducting wire. Fingers and thumb play different roles in
the two.

This example possesses the required symmetry so that Ampere’s
law can be applied readily.
It should be noted that while Ampere’s circuital law holds for any
loop, it may not always facilitate an evaluation of the magnetic field in
every case. For example, for the case of the circular loop discussed in
Section 4.6, it cannot be applied to extract the simple expression
B = mI/2R [Eq. (4.16)] for the field at the centre of the loop. However,

there exists a large number of situations of high symmetry where the law

magnetic systems: the solenoid and the toroid.

HE OLENOID
We shall discuss a long solenoid. By long solenoid we mean that the
solenoid’s length is large compared to its radius. It consists of a long wire
wound in the form of a helix where the neighbouring turns are closely
spaced. So each turn can be regarded as a circular loop. The net magnetic
field is the vector sum of the fields due to all the turns. Enamelled wires
are used for winding so that turns are insulated from each other.
FIGURE 4.15 (a) The magnetic field due to a section of the solenoid which has been
stretched out for clarity. Only the exterior semi-circular part is shown. Notice
how the circular loops between neighbouring turns tend to cancel.
(b) The magnetic field of a finite solenoid.
Figure 4.15 displays the magnetic field lines for a finite solenoid. We
show a section of this solenoid in an enlarged manner in Fig. 4.15(a).
Figure 4.15(b) shows the entire finite solenoid with its magnetic field. In
Fig. 4.15(a), it is clear from the circular loops that the field between two
neighbouring turns vanishes. In Fig. 4.15(b), we see that the field at the
interior mid-point P is uniform, strong and along the axis of the solenoid.
The field at the exterior mid-point Q is weak and moreover is along the
axis of the solenoid with no perpendicular or normal component. As the

solenoid is made longer it appears like a long cylindrical metal sheet.
Figure 4.16 represents this idealised picture. The field outside the solenoid
approaches zero. We shall assume that the field outside is zero. The field
inside becomes everywhere parallel to the axis.
Consider a rectangular Amperian loop abcd. Along cd the field is zero
as argued above. Along transverse sections bc and ad, the field component
is zero. Thus, these two sections make no contribution. Let the field along
ab be B. Thus, the relevant length of the Amperian loop is, L = h.
Let n be the number of turns per unit length, then the total number
of turns is nh. The enclosed current is, I = I (n h), where I is the current

The direction of the field is given by the right-hand rule. The solenoid
is commonly used to obtain a uniform magnetic field. We shall see in the
next chapter that a large field is possible by inserting a soft iron core
inside the solenoid.
Example 4.9 A solenoid of length 0.5 m has a radius of 1 cm and is
made up of 500 turns. It carries a current of 5 A. What is the
magnitude of the magnetic field inside the solenoid?
Solution The number of turns per unit length is,

We have learnt that there exists a magnetic field due to a
conductor carrying a current which obeys the Biot-Savart
law. Further, we have learnt that an external magnetic field
will exert a force on a current-carrying conductor. This
follows from the Lorentz force formula. Thus, it is logical
to expect that two current-carrying conductors placed near
each other will exert (magnetic) forces on each other. In
the period 1820-25, Ampere studied the nature of this

The conductor ‘a’ produces, the same magnetic field B at all points

The conductor ‘b’ carrying a current I will experience a sideways

Eq. (4.4),
F = I L B

It is of course possible to compute the force on ‘a’ due to ‘b’. From

and directed towards ‘b’. Thus,
F = –F (4.24)
ba ab
Note that this is consistent with Newton’s third Law. Thus, at least for
parallel conductors and steady currents, we have shown that the
Biot-Savart law and the Lorentz force yield results in accordance with
Newton’s third Law*.
We have seen from above that currents flowing in the same direction
attract each other. One can show that oppositely directed currents repel
each other. Thus,
Parallel currents attract, and antiparallel currents repel.
This rule is the opposite of what we find in electrostatics. Like (same
sign) charges repel each other, but like (parallel) currents attract each
other.

* It turns out that when we have time-dependent currents and/or charges in
motion, Newton’s third law may not hold for forces between charges and/or
conductors. An essential consequence of the Newton’s third law in mechanics
is conservation of momentum of an isolated system. This, however, holds even
for the case of time-dependent situations with electromagnetic fields, provided 123
the momentum carried by fields is also taken into account.

The ampere is the value of that steady current which, when maintained
in each of the two very long, straight, parallel conductors of negligible
cross-section, and placed one metre apart in vacuum, would produce
on each of these conductors a force equal to 2 × 10–7 newtons per metre
of length.
This definition of the ampere was adopted in 1946. It is a theoretical
definition. In practice, one must eliminate the effect of the earth’s magnetic
field and substitute very long wires by multiturn coils of appropriate
geometries. An instrument called the current balance is used to measure
this mechanical force.
The SI unit of charge, namely, the coulomb, can now be defined in
terms of the ampere.
When a steady current of 1A is set up in a conductor, the quantity of
charge that flows through its cross-section in 1s is one coulomb (1C).
Example 4.10 The horizontal component of the earth’s magnetic field
at a certain place is 3.0 ×10–5 T and the direction of the field is from
the geographic south to the geographic north. A very long straight
conductor is carrying a steady current of 1A. What is the force per
unit length on it when it is placed on a horizontal table and the
direction of the current is (a) east to west; (b) south to north?
Solution F = Il × B
F = IlB sinq
The force per unit length is
f = F/l = I B sinq
(a) When the current is flowing from east to west,
q = 90°
Hence,
f = I B
= 1 × 3 × 10–5 = 3 × 10–5 N m–1
This is larger than the value 2×10–7 Nm–1 quoted in the definition
of the ampere. Hence it is important to eliminate the effect of the
earth’s magnetic field and other stray fields while standardising
the ampere.
The direction of the force is downwards. This direction may be
obtained by the directional property of cross product of vectors.
(b) When the current is flowing from south to north,
q = 0o
f = 0
Hence there is no force on the conductor.

4.9.1 Torque on a rectangular current loop in a uniform
magnetic field
We now show that a rectangular loop carrying a steady current I and
placed in a uniform magnetic field experiences a torque. It does not
experience a net force. This behaviour is analogous to that of electric
dipole in a uniform electric field (Section 1.12).
Rationalised 2023-24Moving Charges and
Magnetism
We first consider the simple case when the
rectangular loop is placed such that the uniform
magnetic field B is in the plane of the loop. This is
illustrated in Fig. 4.18(a).
The field exerts no force on the two arms AD and BC
of the loop. It is perpendicular to the arm AB of the loop
and exerts a force F on it which is directed into the
1
plane of the loop. Its magnitude is,
F = I b B
1
Similarly, it exerts a force F on the arm CD and F
2 2
is directed out of the plane of the paper.
F = I b B = F
2 1
Thus, the net force on the loop is zero. There is a
torque on the loop due to the pair of forces F and F .

Figure 4.18(b) shows a view of the loop from the AD
end. It shows that the torque on the loop tends to rotate
it anticlockwise. This torque is (in magnitude),

q = p/2). Figure 4.19 illustrates this general case.
The forces on the arms BC and DA are equal, opposite, and act along
the axis of the coil, which connects the centres of mass of BC and DA.
Being collinear along the axis they cancel each other, resulting in no net
force or torque. The forces on arms AB and CD are F and F . They too
1 2
are equal and opposite, with magnitude,
F = F = I b B
1 2
But they are not collinear! This results in a couple as before. The
torque is, however, less than the earlier case when plane of loop was
along the magnetic field. This is because the perpendicular distance
between the forces of the couple has decreased. Figure 4.19(b) is a view
of the arrangement from the AD end and it illustrates these two forces
constituting a couple. The magnitude of the torque on the loop is,

ELPMAXE
As q (cid:224) 0, the perpendicular distance between
the forces of the couple also approaches zero. This
makes the forces collinear and the net force and
torque zero. The torques in Eqs. (4.26) and (4.27)
can be expressed as vector product of the magnetic
moment of the coil and the magnetic field.
We define the magnetic moment of the current
loop as,
m = I A (4.28)
where the direction of the area vector A is given by
the right-hand thumb rule and is directed into
the plane of the paper in Fig. 4.18. Then as the
angle between m and B is q , Eqs. (4.26) and (4.27)
can be expressed by one expression
(4.29)
This is analogous to the electrostatic case
(Electric dipole of dipole moment p in an electric
e
field E).
ττ = p ××E
e
As is clear from Eq. (4.28), the dimensions of the
magnetic moment are [A][L2] and its unit is Am2.

a stable one. Any small rotation of the coil
produces a torque which brings it back to its original position. When
they are antiparallel, the equilibrium is unstable as any rotation produces
a torque which increases with the amount of rotation. The presence of
this torque is also the reason why a small magnet or any magnetic dipole
aligns itself with the external magnetic field.
If the loop has N closely wound turns, the expression for torque, Eq.
(4.29), still holds, with
m = N I A (4.30)
Example 4.11 A 100 turn closely wound circular coil of radius 10 cm

The coil is placed in a vertical plane and is free to rotate about a
horizontal axis which coincides with its diameter. A uniform magnetic
field of 2T in the horizontal direction exists such that initially the axis
of the coil is in the direction of the field. The coil rotates through an
angle of 90° under the influence of the magnetic field. (c) What are the
magnitudes of the torques on the coil in the initial and final position?

maximum.
(c) A loop of irregular shape carrying current is located in an external

Solution
(a) No, because that would require ttttt to be in the vertical direction.
But ttttt = I A × B, and since A of the horizontal loop is in the vertical
direction, t would be in the plane of the loop for any B.
(b) Orientation of stable equilibrium is one where the area vector A
of the loop is in the direction of external magnetic field. In this
orientation, the magnetic field produced by the loop is in the same
direction as external field, both normal to the plane of the loop,
thus giving rise to maximum flux of the total field.
(c) It assumes circular shape with its plane normal to the field to
maximise flux, since for a given perimeter, a circle encloses greater
area than any other shape.
4.9.2 Circular current loop as a magnetic dipole
In this section, we shall consider the elementary magnetic element: the
current loop. We shall show that the magnetic field (at large distances)
due to current in a circular current loop is very similar in behaviour to
the electric field of an electric dipole. In Section 4.6, we have evaluated
the magnetic field on the axis of a circular loop, of a radius R, carrying a
steady current I. The magnitude of this field is [(Eq. (4.15)],
m IR2
B = 0
( )
2 x2 +R2 3/2
and its direction is along the axis and given by the right-hand thumb
rule (Fig. 4.12). Here, x is the distance along the axis from the centre of
the loop. For x >> R, we may drop the R2 term in the denominator. Thus,
m IR2

Note that the area of the loop A = pR2. Thus,

considered in Chapter 1, Section 1.10 [Eq. (1.20)].
It can be shown that the above analogy can be carried further. We
had found in Chapter 1 that the electric field on the perpendicular bisector
of the dipole is given by [See Eq.(1.21)],
p
E ≃ e

plane of the loop at a distance x from the centre. For x >>R,
µ m
B ≃ 0 ; x >>R [4.31(b)]
4π x3
The results given by Eqs. [4.31(a)] and [4.31(b)] become exact for a
point magnetic dipole.
The results obtained above can be shown to apply to any planar loop:
a planar current loop is equivalent to a magnetic dipole of dipole moment
m = I A, which is the analogue of electric dipole moment p. Note, however,
a fundamental difference: an electric dipole is built up of two elementary
units — the charges (or electric monopoles). In magnetism, a magnetic
dipole (or a current loop) is the most elementary element. The equivalent
of electric charges, i.e., magnetic monopoles, are not known to exist.
We have shown that a current loop (i) produces a magnetic field and
behaves like a magnetic dipole at large distances, and
(ii) is subject to torque like a magnetic needle. This led Ampere to suggest
that all magnetism is due to circulating currents. This seems to be partly
true and no magnetic monopoles have been seen so far. However,
elementary particles such as an electron or a proton also carry an intrinsic
magnetic moment, not accounted by circulating currents.

Currents and voltages in circuits have been discussed extensively in
Chapters 3. But how do we measure them? How do we claim that
current in a circuit is 1.5 A or the voltage drop across a resistor is 1.2 V?
Figure 4.20 exhibits a very useful instrument for this purpose: the moving
coil galvanometer (MCG). It is a device whose principle can be understood
on the basis of our discussion in Section 4.10.
The galvanometer consists of a coil, with many turns, free to rotate
about a fixed axis (Fig. 4.20), in a uniform radial magnetic field. There is
a cylindrical soft iron core which not only makes the field radial but also
increases the strength of the magnetic field. When a current flows through
the coil, a torque acts on it. This torque is given by Eq. (4.26) to be

the field is radial by design, we have taken sin q = 1 in
the above expression for the torque. The magnetic
torque NIAB tends to rotate the coil. A spring S

magnetic torque NIAB; resulting in a steady angular

deflection is either to the right or the left.
The galvanometer cannot as such be used as an
ammeter to measure the value of the current in a given circuit. This is for
two reasons: (i) Galvanometer is a very sensitive device, it gives a full-
scale deflection for a current of the order of mA. (ii) For measuring currents,
the galvanometer has to be connected in series, and as it has a large
resistance, this will change the value of the current in the circuit. To
overcome these difficulties, one attaches a small resistance r , called shunt
s
resistance, in parallel with the galvanometer coil; so that most of the
current passes through the shunt. The resistance of this arrangement is,
≃
R r / (R + r ) r if R >> r
G s G s s G s
If r has small value, in relation to the resistance of the rest of the
s
circuit R , the effect of introducing the measuring instrument is also small

and negligible. This arrangement is schematically shown in Fig. 4.21.

A convenient way for the manufacturer to increase the sensitivity is
to increase the number of turns N. We choose galvanometers having

The galvanometer can also be used as a voltmeter to measure the
voltage across a given section of the circuit. For this it must be connected
in parallel with that section of the circuit. Further, it must draw a very
small current, otherwise the voltage measurement will disturb the original
set up by an amount which is very large. Usually we like to keep the
disturbance due to the measuring device below one per cent. To ensure
this, a large resistance R is connected in series with the galvanometer.
This arrangement is schematically depicted in Fig.4.22. Note that the
resistance of the voltmeter is now,

An interesting point to note is that increasing the current sensitivity
may not necessarily increase the voltage sensitivity. Let us take Eq. (4.39)
which provides a measure of current sensitivity. If N fi 2N, i.e., we double
the number of turns, then
φ φ

I I
Thus, the current sensitivity doubles. However, the resistance of the
galvanometer is also likely to double, since it is proportional to the length
of the wire. In Eq. (4.40), N fi2N, and R fi2R, thus the voltage sensitivity,
φ φ

remains unchanged. So in general, the modification needed for conversion
of a galvanometer to an ammeter will be different from what is needed for
converting it into a voltmeter.
Example 4.13 In the circuit (Fig. 4.23) the current is to be
measured. What is the value of the current if the ammeter shown
(a) is a galvanometer with a resistance R = 60.00 W; (b) is a

galvanometer described in (a) but converted to an ammeter by a
shunt resistance r = 0.02 W; (c) is an ideal ammeter with zero

SUMMARY
1. The total force on a charge q moving with velocity v in the presence of
magnetic and electric fields B and E, respectively is called the Lorentz
force. It is given by the expression:
F = q (v × B + E)
The magnetic force q (v × B) is normal to v and work done by it is zero.
2. A straight conductor of length l and carrying a steady current I
experiences a force F in a uniform external magnetic field B,
F = I l × B
where|l| = l and the direction of l is given by the direction of the
current.
3. In a uniform magnetic field B, a charge q executes a circular orbit in
a plane normal to B. Its frequency of uniform circular motion is called
the cyclotron frequency and is given by:
qB
n =
c 2p m
This frequency is independent of the particle’s speed and radius. This
fact is exploited in a machine, the cyclotron, which is used to
accelerate charged particles.
4. The Biot-Savart law asserts that the magnetic field dB due to an
element dl carrying a steady current I at a point P at a distance r from
the current element is:
m dl· r
dB= 0 I
4p r3
To obtain the total field at P, we must integrate this vector expression
over the entire length of the conductor.
5. The magnitude of the magnetic field due to a circular coil of radius R
carrying a current I at an axial distance x from the centre is

6. Ampere’s Circuital Law: Let an open surface S be bounded by a loop

the current passing through S. The sign of I is determined from the
right-hand rule. We have discussed a simplified form of this law. If B
is directed along the tangent to every point on the perimeter L of a
closed curve and is constant in magnitude along perimeter then,
BL = m I
0 e
where I is the net current enclosed by the closed circuit.

7. The magnitude of the magnetic field at a distance R from a long,
straight wire carrying a current I is given by:
m I
B = 0
2πR
The field lines are circles concentric with the wire.
8. The magnitude of the field B inside a long solenoid carrying a current
I is
B = mnI
0
where n is the number of turns per unit length.
where N is the total number of turns and r is the average radius.
9. Parallel currents attract and anti-parallel currents repel.
10. A planar loop carrying a current I, having N closely wound turns, and
an area A possesses a magnetic moment m where,
m = N I A
and the direction of m is given by the right-hand thumb rule : curl
the palm of your right hand along the loop with the fingers pointing
in the direction of the current. The thumb sticking out gives the
direction of m (and A)
When this loop is placed in a uniform magnetic field B, the force F on
it is: F = 0
And the torque on it is,
t = m × B
In a moving coil galvanometer, this torque is balanced by a counter-
torque due to a spring, yielding
kf = NI AB
where f is the equilibrium deflection and k the torsion constant of
the spring.
11. A moving coil galvanometer can be converted into a ammeter by
introducing a shunt resistance r , of small value in parallel. It can be
s
converted into a voltmeter by introducing a resistance of a large value
in series.

POINTS TO PONDER
1. Electrostatic field lines originate at a positive charge and terminate at a
negative charge or fade at infinity. Magnetic field lines always form
closed loops.
2. The discussion in this Chapter holds only for steady currents which do
not vary with time.
When currents vary with time Newton’s third law is valid only if momentum
carried by the electromagnetic field is taken into account.
3. Recall the expression for the Lorentz force,
F = q (v × B + E)
This velocity dependent force has occupied the attention of some of the
greatest scientific thinkers. If one switches to a frame with instantaneous
velocity v, the magnetic part of the force vanishes. The motion of the
charged particle is then explained by arguing that there exists an
appropriate electric field in the new frame. We shall not discuss the
details of this mechanism. However, we stress that the resolution of this
paradox implies that electricity and magnetism are linked phenomena
(electromagnetism) and that the Lorentz force expression does not imply
a universal preferred frame of reference in nature.
4. Ampere’s Circuital law is not independent of the Biot-Savart law. It
can be derived from the Biot-Savart law. Its relationship to the
Biot-Savart law is similar to the relationship between Gauss’s law and
Coulomb’s law.
