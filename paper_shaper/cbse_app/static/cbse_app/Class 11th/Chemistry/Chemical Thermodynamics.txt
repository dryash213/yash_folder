Thermodynamics deals with energy changes in chemical or physical processes and enables us to
study these changes quantitatively and to make useful predictions. For these purposes, we divide
the universe into the system and the surroundings. Chemical or physical processes lead to evolution
or absorption of heat (q), part of which may be converted into work (w). These quantities are related
through the first law of thermodynamics via ∆U = q + w. ∆U, change in internal energy, depends
on initial and final states only and is a state function, whereas q and w depend on the path and
are not the state functions. We follow sign conventions of q and w by giving the positive sign to
these quantities when these are added to the system. We can measure the transfer of heat from one
system to another which causes the change in temperature. The magnitude of rise in temperature
depends on the heat capacity (C) of a substance. Therefore, heat absorbed or evolved is q = C∆T.
Work can be measured by w = –p ∆V, in case of expansion of gases. Under reversible process, we
ex
can put p = pfor infinitesimal changes in the volume making w = – p dV. In this condition, we
ex rev
can use gas equation, pV = nRT.
At constant volume, w = 0, then ∆U = q , heat transfer at constant volume. But in study of
V
chemical reactions, we usually have constant pressure. We define another state function enthalpy.
Enthalpy change, ∆H = ∆U + ∆nRT, can be found directly from the heat changes at constant pressure,
g
∆H = q .
p
There are varieties of enthalpy changes. Changes of phase such as melting, vaporization and
sublimation usually occur at constant temperature and can be characterized by enthalpy changes
which are always positive. Enthalpy of formation, combustion and other enthalpy changes can be
calculated using Hess’s law. Enthalpy change for chemical reactions can be determined by
 H  a  H  b H 
r i f products i f reactions
f i
and in gaseous state by
∆H = Σ bond enthalpies of the reactants – Σ bond enthalpies of the products
r
First law of thermodynamics does not guide us about the direction of chemical
reactions i.e., what is the driving force of a chemical reaction. For isolated systems,
∆U = 0. We define another state function, S, entropy for this purpose. entropy is a measure
of disorder or randomness. For a spontaneous change, total entropy change is positive.
Therefore, for an isolated system, ∆U = 0, ∆S > 0, so entropy change distinguishes a spontaneous
change, while energy change does not. Entropy changes can be measured by the equation
q q
∆S = rev for a reversible process. rev is independent of path.
T T
Chemical reactions are generally carried at constant pressure, so we define another state function
gibbs energy, G, which is related to entropy and enthalpy changes of the system by the equation:
∆G = ∆H – T ∆S
r r r
For a spontaneous change, ∆G < 0 and at equilibrium, ∆G = 0.
sys sys
Standard Gibbs energy change is related to equilibrium constant by
∆G = – RT ln K.
r
K can be calculated from this equation, if we know ∆ G which can be found from
r
. Temperature is an important factor in the equation. Many reactions which
are non-spontaneous at low temperature, are made spontaneous at high temperature for systems
having positive entropy of reaction.
