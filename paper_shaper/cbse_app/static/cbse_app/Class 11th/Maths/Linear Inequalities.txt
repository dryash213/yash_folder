6.1 Introduction
Suppose you have a suitcase with a number lock. The number
lock has 4 wheels each labelled with 10 digits from 0 to 9.
The lock can be opened if 4 specific digits are arranged in a
particular sequence with no repetition. Some how, you have
forgotten this specific sequence of digits. You remember only
the first digit which is 7. In order to open the lock, how
many sequences of 3-digits you may have to check with? To
answer this question, you may, immediately, start listing all
possible arrangements of 9 remaining digits taken 3 at a
time. But, this method will be tedious, because the number
Jacob Bernoulli
of possible sequences may be large. Here, in this Chapter,
(1654-1705)
we shall learn some basic counting techniques which will
enable us to answer this question without actually listing 3-digit arrangements. In fact,
these techniques will be useful in determining the number of different ways of arranging
and selecting objects without actually listing them. As a first step, we shall examine a
principle which is most fundamental to the learning of these techniques.
6.2 Fundamental Principle of Counting
Let us consider the following problem. Mohan has 3 pants and 2 shirts. How many
different pairs of a pant and a shirt, can he dress up with? There are 3 ways in which
a pant can be chosen, because there are 3 pants available. Similarly, a shirt can be
chosen in 2 ways. For every choice of a pant, there are 2 choices of a shirt. Therefore,
there are 3 × 2 = 6 pairs of a pant and a shirt.
2024-25PERMUTATIONS AND COMBINATIONS 101
Let us name the three pants as P , P , P and the two shirts as S , S . Then,
1 2 3 1 2
these six possibilities can be illustrated in the Fig. 6.1.
Let us consider another problem
of the same type.
Sabnam has 2 school bags, 3 tiffin boxes
and 2 water bottles. In how many ways
can she carry these items (choosing one
each).
A school bag can be chosen in 2
different ways. After a school bag is
chosen, a tiffin box can be chosen in 3
different ways. Hence, there are
2 × 3 = 6 pairs of school bag and a tiffin
box. For each of these pairs a water
bottle can be chosen in 2 different ways. Fig 6.1
Hence, there are 6 × 2 = 12 different ways in which, Sabnam can carry these items to
school. If we name the 2 school bags as B , B , the three tiffin boxes as T , T , T and
1 2 1 2 3
the two water bottles as W , W , these possibilities can be illustrated in the Fig. 6.2.

In fact, the problems of the above types are solved by applying the following
principle known as the fundamental principle of counting, or, simply, the multiplication
principle, which states that
“If an event can occur in m different ways, following which another event
can occur in n different ways, then the total number of occurrence of the events
in the given order is m×n.”
The above principle can be generalised for any finite number of events. For
example, for 3 events, the principle is as follows:
‘If an event can occur in m different ways, following which another event can
occur in n different ways, following which a third event can occur in p different ways,
then the total number of occurrence to ‘the events in the given order is m × n × p.”
In the first problem, the required number of ways of wearing a pant and a shirt
was the number of different ways of the occurence of the following events in succession:
(i) the event of choosing a pant
(ii) the event of choosing a shirt.
In the second problem, the required number of ways was the number of different
ways of the occurence of the following events in succession:
(i) the event of choosing a school bag
(ii) the event of choosing a tiffin box
(iii) the event of choosing a water bottle.
Here, in both the cases, the events in each problem could occur in various possible
orders. But, we have to choose any one of the possible orders and count the number of
different ways of the occurence of the events in this chosen order.
Example 1 Find the number of 4 letter words, with or without meaning, which can be
formed out of the letters of the word ROSE, where the repetition of the letters is not
allowed.
Solution There are as many words as there are ways of filling in 4 vacant places
by the 4 letters, keeping in mind that the repetition is not allowed. The
first place can be filled in 4 different ways by anyone of the 4 letters R,O,S,E. Following
which, the second place can be filled in by anyone of the remaining 3 letters in 3
different ways, following which the third place can be filled in 2 different ways; following
which, the fourth place can be filled in 1 way. Thus, the number of ways in which the
4 places can be filled, by the multiplication principle, is 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24. Hence, the
required number of words is 24.
2024-25PERMUTATIONS AND COMBINATIONS 103
A
Note If the repetition of the letters was allowed, how many words can be formed?
One can easily understand that each of the 4 vacant places can be filled in succession
in 4 different ways. Hence, the required number of words = 4 × 4 × 4 × 4 = 256.
Example 2 Given 4 flags of different colours, how many different signals can be
generated, if a signal requires the use of 2 flags one below the other?
Solution There will be as many signals as there are ways of filling in 2 vacant places
in succession by the 4 flags of different colours. The upper vacant place can
be filled in 4 different ways by anyone of the 4 flags; following which, the lower vacant
place can be filled in 3 different ways by anyone of the remaining 3 different flags.
Hence, by the multiplication principle, the required number of signals = 4 × 3 = 12.
Example 3 How many 2 digit even numbers can be formed from the digits
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 if the digits can be repeated?
Solution There will be as many ways as there are ways of filling 2 vacant places
in succession by the five given digits. Here, in this case, we start filling in unit’s
place, because the options for this place are 2 and 4 only and this can be done in 2
ways; following which the ten’s place can be filled by any of the 5 digits in 5 different
ways as the digits can be repeated. Therefore, by the multiplication principle, the required
number of two digits even numbers is 2 × 5, i.e., 10.
Example 4 Find the number of different signals that can be generated by arranging at
least 2 flags in order (one below the other) on a vertical staff, if five different flags are
available.
Solution A signal can consist of either 2 flags, 3 flags, 4 flags or 5 flags. Now, let us
count the possible number of signals consisting of 2 flags, 3 flags, 4 flags and 5 flags
separately and then add the respective numbers.
There will be as many 2 flag signals as there are ways of filling in 2 vacant places
in succession by the 5 flags available. By Multiplication rule, the number of
ways is 5 × 4 = 20.
Similarly, there will be as many 3 flag signals as there are ways of filling in 3
vacant places in succession by the 5 flags.
2024-25104 MATHEMATICS
The number of ways is 5 × 4 × 3 = 60.
Continuing the same way, we find that
The number of 4 flag signals = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 = 120
and the number of 5 flag signals = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120
Therefore, the required no of signals = 20 + 60 + 120 + 120 = 320.

6.3 Permutations
In Example 1 of the previous Section, we are actually counting the different possible
arrangements of the letters such as ROSE, REOS, ..., etc. Here, in this list, each
arrangement is different from other. In other words, the order of writing the letters is
important. Each arrangement is called a permutation of 4 different letters taken all
at a time. Now, if we have to determine the number of 3-letter words, with or without
meaning, which can be formed out of the letters of the word NUMBER, where the
repetition of the letters is not allowed, we need to count the arrangements NUM,
NMU, MUN, NUB, ..., etc. Here, we are counting the permutations of 6 different
letters taken 3 at a time. The required number of words = 6 × 5 × 4 = 120 (by using
multiplication principle).
If the repetition of the letters was allowed, the required number of words would
be 6 × 6 × 6 = 216.
2024-25PERMUTATIONS AND COMBINATIONS 105
Definition 1 A permutation is an arrangement in a definite order of a number of
objects taken some or all at a time.
In the following sub-section, we shall obtain the formula needed to answer these
questions immediately.
6.3.1 Permutations when all the objects are distinct
Theorem 1 The number of permutations of n different objects taken r at a time,
where 0 < r ≤ n and the objects do not repeat is n ( n – 1) ( n – 2). . .( n – r + 1),
which is denoted by nP.
r
Proof There will be as many permutations as there are ways of filling in r vacant
places . . . by
← r vacant places →
the n objects. The first place can be filled in n ways; following which, the second place
can be filled in (n – 1) ways, following which the third place can be filled in (n – 2)
ways,..., the rth place can be filled in (n – (r – 1)) ways. Therefore, the number of
ways of filling in r vacant places in succession is n(n – 1) (n – 2) . . . (n – (r – 1)) or
n ( n – 1) (n – 2) ... (n – r + 1)
This expression for nP is cumbersome and we need a notation which will help to
r
reduce the size of this expression. The symbol n! (read as factorial n or n factorial )
comes to our rescue. In the following text we will learn what actually n! means.
6.3.2 Factorial notation The notation n! represents the product of first n natural
numbers, i.e., the product 1 × 2 × 3 × . . . × (n – 1) × n is denoted as n!. We read this
symbol as ‘n factorial’. Thus, 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 . . . × (n – 1) × n = n !
1 = 1 !
1 × 2 = 2 !
1× 2 × 3 = 3 !
1 × 2 × 3 × 4 = 4 ! and so on.
We define 0 ! = 1
We can write 5 ! = 5 × 4 ! = 5 × 4 × 3 ! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 !
= 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1!
Clearly, for a natural number n
n ! = n (n – 1) !
= n (n – 1) (n – 2) ! [provided (n ≥ 2)]
= n (n – 1) (n – 2) (n – 3) ! [provided (n ≥ 3)]
and so on.
2024-25106 MATHEMATICS
Example 5 Evaluate (i) 5 ! (ii) 7 ! (iii) 7 ! – 5!
Solution (i) 5 ! = 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 × 5 = 120
(ii) 7 ! = 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 × 5 × 6 ×7 = 5040
and (iii) 7 ! – 5! = 5040 – 120 = 4920.
7! 12!
Example 6 Compute (i) 5! (ii) (10!)(2!)

Example 7 Evaluate r!(n−r)!, when n = 5, r = 2.
5!
Solution We have to evaluate 2!(5−2)! (since n = 5, r = 2)
5! 5! 5· 4
= =10
We have 2!(5−2)!= 2!· 3! 2 .

6.3.3 Derivation of the formula for nP
r
n!
nP = , 0 ≤ r ≤ n
r (n−r)!
Let us now go back to the stage where we had determined the following formula:
nP = n (n – 1) (n – 2) . . . (n – r + 1)
r
Multiplying numerator and denomirator by (n – r) (n – r – 1) . . . 3 × 2 × 1, we get
n(n−1)(n−2)...(n−r+1)(n−r)(n−r−1)...3×2×1
n!
nP =
r (n−r)(n−r−1)...3×2×1 = (n−r)!,
n!
nP =
Thus r (n−r)!, where 0 < r ≤n
This is a much more convenient expression for nP than the previous one.
r
n!
In particular, when r = n, nP = =n!
n 0!
Counting permutations is merely counting the number of ways in which some or
all objects at a time are rearranged. Arranging no object at all is the same as leaving
behind all the objects and we know that there is only one way of doing so. Thus, we
can have
n! n!
=
n P = 1 = ... (1)
0 n! (n- 0)!
Therefore, the formula (1) is applicable for r = 0 also.
n!
nP = ,0≤r≤n
Thus r (n−r)! .

Theorem 2 The number of permutations of n different objects taken r at a time,
where repetition is allowed, is nr.
Proof is very similar to that of Theorem 1 and is left for the reader to arrive at.
Here, we are solving some of the problems of the pervious Section using the
formula for nP to illustrate its usefulness.

In Example 1, the required number of words = 4P = 4! = 24. Here repetition is

6.3.4 Permutations when all the objects are not distinct objects Suppose we have
to find the number of ways of rearranging the letters of the word ROOT. In this case,
the letters of the word are not all different. There are 2 Os, which are of the same kind.
Let us treat, temporarily, the 2 Os as different, say, O and O . The number of
1 2
permutations of 4-different letters, in this case, taken all at a time
is 4!. Consider one of these permutations say, RO O T. Corresponding to this
1 2
permutation,we have 2 ! permutations RO O T and RO O T which will be exactly the
1 2 2 1

Let us now find the number of ways of rearranging the letters of the word
INSTITUTE. In this case there are 9 letters, in which I appears 2 times and T appears
3 times.
Temporarily, let us treat these letters different and name them as I , I , T , T , T .
1 2 1 2 3
The number of permutations of 9 different letters, in this case, taken all at a time is 9 !.
Consider one such permutation, say, I NT SI T U E T . Here if I , I are not same
1 1 2 2 3 1 2
2024-25110 MATHEMATICS
and T , T , T are not same, then I , I can be arranged in 2! ways and T , T , T can
1 2 3 1 2 1 2 3
be arranged in 3! ways. Therefore, 2! × 3! permutations will be just the same permutation
corresponding to this chosen permutation I NT SI T UET . Hence, total number of

We can state (without proof) the following theorems:

Solution Here, there are 9 objects (letters) of which there are 4A’s, 2 L’s and rest are

Example 10 How many 4-digit numbers can be formed by using the digits 1 to 9 if
repetition of digits is not allowed?
Solution Here order matters for example 1234 and 1324 are two different numbers.
Therefore, there will be as many 4 digit numbers as there are permutations of 9 different
digits taken 4 at a time.
9! 9!
Therefore, the required 4 digit numbers =9P = = = 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 = 3024.

Example 11 How many numbers lying between 100 and 1000 can be formed with the
digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, if the repetition of the digits is not allowed?
Solution Every number between 100 and 1000 is a 3-digit number. We, first, have to
2024-25PERMUTATIONS AND COMBINATIONS 111
count the permutations of 6 digits taken 3 at a time. This number would be 6P . But,
3
these permutations will include those also where 0 is at the 100’s place. For example,
092, 042, . . ., etc are such numbers which are actually 2-digit numbers and hence the
number of such numbers has to be subtracted from 6P to get the required number. To
3
get the number of such numbers, we fix 0 at the 100’s place and rearrange the remaining
5 digits taking 2 at a time. This number is 5P . So

The required number = 6P − 5P = −

nP =42 nP
5 3
or n (n – 1) (n – 2) (n – 3) (n – 4) = 42 n(n – 1) (n – 2)
Since n > 4 so n(n – 1) (n – 2) ≠ 0
Therefore, by dividing both sides by n(n – 1) (n – 2), we get
(n – 3 (n – 4) = 42
or n2 – 7n – 30 = 0
or n2 – 10n + 3n – 30
or (n – 10) (n + 3) = 0
or n – 10 = 0or n + 3 = 0
or n = 10 or n = – 3
As n cannot be negative, so n = 10.

(ii) Given that 4 =

Therefore 3n (n – 1) (n – 2) (n – 3) = 5(n – 1) (n – 2) (n – 3) (n – 4)
or 3n = 5 (n – 4) [as (n – 1) (n – 2) (n – 3) ≠ 0, n > 4]
or n = 10.

or (r – 8) (r – 3) = 0
or r = 8 or r = 3.
Hence r = 8, 3.
Example 14 Find the number of different 8-letter arrangements that can be made
from the letters of the word DAUGHTER so that
(i) all vowels occur together (ii) all vowels do not occur together.
Solution(i) There are 8 different letters in the word DAUGHTER, in which there
are 3 vowels, namely, A, U and E. Since the vowels have to occur together, we can for
the time being, assume them as a single object (AUE). This single object together with
5 remaining letters (objects) will be counted as 6 objects. Then we count permutations
of these 6 objects taken all at a time. This number would be 6P = 6!. Corresponding to
6
each of these permutations, we shall have 3! permutations of the three vowels A, U, E
taken all at a time . Hence, by the multiplication principle the required number of
permutations = 6 ! × 3 ! = 4320.
(ii) If we have to count those permutations in which all vowels are never
together, we first have to find all possible arrangments of 8 letters taken all at a time,
which can be done in 8! ways. Then, we have to subtract from this number, the number
of permutations in which the vowels are always together.
Therefore, the required number 8 ! – 6 ! × 3 ! = 6 ! (7×8 – 6)
= 2 × 6 ! (28 – 3)
= 50 × 6 ! = 50 × 720 = 36000
Example 15 In how many ways can 4 red, 3 yellow and 2 green discs be arranged in

2024-25PERMUTATIONS AND COMBINATIONS 113

(iv) do the words begin with I and end in P?
Solution There are 12 letters, of which N appears 3 times, E appears 4 times and D
appears 2 times and the rest are all different. Therefore

The required number of arrangements

(ii) There are 5 vowels in the given word, which are 4 Es and 1 I. Since, they have
to always occur together, we treat them as a single object EEEEI for the time
being. This single object together with 7 remaining objects will account for 8
objects. These 8 objects, in which there are 3Ns and 2 Ds, can be rearranged in
8!
ways. Corresponding to each of these arrangements, the 5 vowels E, E, E,

= 1663200 – 16800 = 1646400
(iv) Let us fix I and P at the extreme ends (I at the left end and P at the right end).
We are left with 10 letters.
Hence, the required number of arrangements

6.4 Combinations
Let us now assume that there is a group of 3 lawn tennis players X, Y, Z. A team
consisting of 2 players is to be formed. In how many ways can we do so? Is the team
of X and Y different from the team of Y and X ? Here, order is not important.
In fact, there are only 3 possible ways in which the team could be constructed.
2024-25PERMUTATIONS AND COMBINATIONS 115
Fig. 6.3
These are XY, YZ and ZX (Fig 6.3).
Here, each selection is called a combination of 3 different objects taken 2 at a time.
In a combination, the order is not important.
Now consider some more illustrations.
Twelve persons meet in a room and each shakes hand with all the others. How do
we determine the number of hand shakes. X shaking hands with Y and Y with X will
not be two different hand shakes. Here, order is not important. There will be as many
hand shakes as there are combinations of 12 different things taken 2 at a time.
Seven points lie on a circle. How many chords can be drawn by joining these
points pairwise? There will be as many chords as there are combinations of 7 different
things taken 2 at a time.
Now, we obtain the formula for finding the number of combinations of n different
objects taken r at a time, denoted by nC..
r
Suppose we have 4 different objects A, B, C and D. Taking 2 at a time, if we have
to make combinations, these will be AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD. Here, AB and BA are
the same combination as order does not alter the combination. This is why we have not
included BA, CA, DA, CB, DB and DC in this list. There are as many as 6 combinations
of 4 different objects taken 2 at a time, i.e., 4C = 6.
2
Corresponding to each combination in the list, we can arrive at 2! permutations as
2 objects in each combination can be rearranged in 2! ways. Hence, the number of
permutations = 4C × 2!.

On the other hand, the number of permutations of 4 different things taken 2 at
a time = 4P .

Therefore 4P

Now, let us suppose that we have 5 different objects A, B, C, D, E. Taking 3 at a
time, if we have to make combinations, these will be ABC, ABD, ABE, BCD, BCE,
CDE, ACE, ACD, ADE, BDE. Corresponding to each of these 5C combinations, there
3
are 3! permutations, because, the three objects in each combination can be
2024-25116 MATHEMATICS
rearranged in 3 ! ways. Therefore, the total of permutations = 5C ×3!
3
5!
= 5C
Therefore 5P 3 = 5C 3 × 3! or (5−3)! 3! 3
These examples suggest the following theorem showing relationship between
permutaion and combination:
Theorem 5 nP = nC r!, 0 < r ≤ n.
r r
Proof Corresponding to each combination of nC, we have r ! permutations, because
r
r objects in every combination can be rearranged in r ! ways.
Hence, the total number of permutations of n different things taken r at a time
is nC × r!. On the other hand, it is nP . Thus
r r
nP = nC ×r!, 0<r≤n.
r r
n! n!
= nC ×r! nC =
Remarks 1. From above (n−r)! r , i.e., r r!(n−r)! .
n!
In particular, if r =n , nC = =1.
n n! 0!
2. We define nC = 1, i.e., the number of combinations of n different things taken
0
nothing at all is considered to be 1. Counting combinations is merely counting the
number of ways in which some or all objects at a time are selected. Selecting
nothing at all is the same as leaving behind all the objects and we know that there
is only one way of doing so. This way we define nC = 1.

n! n!
3. As =1= nC , the formula nC = is applicable for r = 0 also.

Miscellaneous Examples
Example 20 How many words, with or without meaning, each of 3 vowels and 2
consonants can be formed from the letters of the word INVOLUTE ?
Solution In the word INVOLUTE, there are 4 vowels, namely, I,O,E,Uand 4
consonants, namely, N, V, L and T.
2024-25120 MATHEMATICS
The number of ways of selecting 3 vowels out of 4 = 4C = 4.
3
The number of ways of selecting 2 consonants out of 4 = 4C = 6.
2
Therefore, the number of combinations of 3 vowels and 2 consonants is
4 × 6 = 24.
Now, each of these 24 combinations has 5 letters which can be arranged among
themselves in 5 ! ways. Therefore, the required number of different words is
24 × 5 ! = 2880.
Example 21 A group consists of 4 girls and 7 boys. In how many ways can a team of
5 members be selected if the team has (i) no girl ? (ii) at least one boy and one girl ?
(iii) at least 3 girls ?
Solution (i) Since, the team will not include any girl, therefore, only boys are to be
selected. 5 boys out of 7 boys can be selected in 7C ways. Therefore, the required

7C = = =21
number of ways = 5 5! 2! 2
(ii) Since, at least one boy and one girl are to be there in every team. Therefore, the
team can consist of
(a) 1 boy and 4 girls (b) 2 boys and 3 girls
(c) 3 boys and 2 girls (d) 4 boys and 1 girl.
1 boy and 4 girls can be selected in 7C × 4C ways.

1 4 2 3 3 2 4 1
= 7 + 84 + 210 + 140 = 441
(iii) Since, the team has to consist of at least 3 girls, the team can consist of
(a) 3 girls and 2 boys, or (b) 4 girls and 1 boy.
Note that the team cannot have all 5 girls, because, the group has only 4 girls.
3 girls and 2 boys can be selected in 4C × 7C ways.
3 2
4 girls and 1 boy can be selected in 4C × 7C ways.

Example 22 Find the number of words with or without meaning which can be made
using all the letters of the word AGAIN. If these words are written as in a dictionary,
what will be the 50th word?
Solution There are 5 letters in the word AGAIN, in which A appears 2 times. Therefore,
5!
the required number of words = = 60.
2!
To get the number of words starting with A, we fix the letter A at the extreme left
position, we then rearrange the remaining 4 letters taken all at a time. There will be as
many arrangements of these 4 letters taken 4 at a time as there are permutations of 4
different things taken 4 at a time. Hence, the number of words starting with
4!
A = 4! = 24. Then, starting with G, the number of words = = 12 as after placing G
2!
at the extreme left position, we are left with the letters A, A, I and N. Similarly, there
are 12 words starting with the next letter I. Total number of words so far obtained

The 49th word is NAAGI. The 50th word is NAAIG.
Example 23 How many numbers greater than 1000000 can be formed by using the
digits 1, 2, 0, 2, 4, 2, 4?
Solution Since, 1000000 is a 7-digit number and the number of digits to be used is also
7. Therefore, the numbers to be counted will be 7-digit only. Also, the numbers have to
be greater than 1000000, so they can begin either with 1, 2 or 4.
6! 4×5×6

The number of numbers beginning with 1 = = 60, as when 1 is

The number of 7-digit arrangements, clearly, =420. But, this will include those

Therefore, the required number of numbers = 420 – 60 = 360.

Note If one or more than one digits given in the list is repeated, it will be
understood that in any number, the digits can be used as many times as is given in
the list, e.g., in the above example 1 and 0 can be used only once whereas 2 and 4
can be used 3 times and 2 times, respectively.
Example 24 In how many ways can 5 girls and 3 boys be seated in a row so that no

arrangement, the three boys can be seated only at the cross marked places.
× G × G × G × G × G ×.
There are 6 cross marked places and the three boys can be seated in 6P ways.

Historical Note
The concepts of permutations and combinations can be traced back to the advent
of Jainism in India and perhaps even earlier. The credit, however, goes to the
Jains who treated its subject matter as a self-contained topic in mathematics,
under the name Vikalpa.
Among the Jains, Mahavira, (around 850) is perhaps the world’s first
mathematician credited with providing the general formulae for permutations and
combinations.
In the 6th century B.C., Sushruta, in his medicinal work, Sushruta Samhita,
asserts that 63 combinations can be made out of 6 different tastes, taken one at a
time, two at a time, etc. Pingala, a Sanskrit scholar around third century B.C.,
gives the method of determining the number of combinations of a given number
of letters, taken one at a time, two at a time, etc. in his work Chhanda Sutra.
Bhaskaracharya (born 1114) treated the subject matter of permutations and
combinations under the name Anka Pasha in his famous work Lilavati. In addition
to the general formulae for nC and nP already provided by Mahavira,
r r
Bhaskaracharya gives several important theorems and results concerning the
subject.
Outside India, the subject matter of permutations and combinations had its
humble beginnings in China in the famous book I–King (Book of changes). It is
difficult to give the approximate time of this work, since in 213 B.C., the emperor
had ordered all books and manuscripts in the country to be burnt which fortunately
was not completely carried out. Greeks and later Latin writers also did some
scattered work on the theory of permutations and combinations.
Some Arabic and Hebrew writers used the concepts of permutations and
combinations in studying astronomy. Rabbi ben Ezra, for instance, determined
the number of combinations of known planets taken two at a time, three at a time
and so on. This was around 1140. It appears that Rabbi ben Ezra did not know
2024-25PERMUTATIONS AND COMBINATIONS 125
the formula for nC. However, he was aware that nC = nC for specific values
r r n–r
n and r. In 1321, Levi Ben Gerson, another Hebrew writer came up with the
formulae for nP , nP and the general formula for nC.
r n r
The first book which gives a complete treatment of the subject matter of
permutations and combinations is Ars Conjectandi written by a Swiss, Jacob
Bernoulli (1654 – 1705), posthumously published in 1713. This book contains
essentially the theory of permutations and combinations as is known today.
