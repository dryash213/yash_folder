9.1 Introduction
We are familiar with two-dimensional coordinate geometry
from earlier classes. Mainly, it is a combination of algebra
and geometry. A systematic study of geometry by the use
of algebra was first carried out by celebrated French
philosopher and mathematician René Descartes, in his book
‘La Géométry, published in 1637. This book introduced the
notion of the equation of a curve and related analytical
methods into the study of geometry. The resulting
combination of analysis and geometry is referred now as
analytical geometry. In the earlier classes, we initiated
the study of coordinate geometry, where we studied about René Descartes
coordinate axes, coordinate plane, plotting of points in a (1596 -1650)
plane, distance between two points, section formulae, etc. All these concepts are the
basics of coordinate geometry.
Let us have a brief recall of coordinate geometry done in earlier classes. To
recapitulate, the location of the points (6, – 4) and
(3, 0) in the XY-plane is shown in Fig 9.1.
We may note that the point (6, – 4) is at 6 units
distance from the y-axis measured along the positive
x-axis and at 4 units distance from the x-axis
measured along the negative y-axis. Similarly, the
point (3, 0) is at 3 units distance from the y-axis
measured along the positive x-axis and has zero
distance from the x-axis.
We also studied there following important

For example, distance between the points (6, – 4) and (3, 0) is

For example, the coordinates of the point which divides the line segment joining

Remark If the area of the triangle ABC is zero, then three points A, B and C lie on
a line, i.e., they are collinear.
In the this Chapter, we shall continue the study of coordinate geometry to study
properties of the simplest geometric figure – straight line. Despite its simplicity, the
line is a vital concept of geometry and enters into our daily experiences in numerous
interesting and useful ways. Main focus is on representing the line algebraically, for
which slope is most essential.
9.2 Slope of a Line
A line in a coordinate plane forms two angles with the x-axis, which are supplementary.
2024-25STRAIGHT LINES 153
The angle (say) θ made by the line l with positive
direction of x-axis and measured anti clockwise
is called the inclination of the line. Obviously
0° ≤ θ ≤ 180° (Fig 9.2).
We observe that lines parallel to x-axis, or
coinciding with x-axis, have inclination of 0°. The
inclination of a vertical line (parallel to or
coinciding with y-axis) is 90°.
Definition 1 If θ is the inclination of a line
l, then tan θ is called the slope or gradient of
the line l. Fig 9.2
The slope of a line whose inclination is 90° is not
defined.
The slope of a line is denoted by m.
Thus, m = tan θ, θ ≠ 90°
It may be observed that the slope of x-axis is zero and slope of y-axis is not defined.
9.2.1 Slope of a line when coordinates of any two points on the line are given
We know that a line is completely determined when we are given two points on it.
Hence, we proceed to find the slope of a
line in terms of the coordinates of two points
on the line.
Let P(x , y ) and Q(x , y ) be two
1 1 2 2
points on non-vertical line l whose inclination
is θ. Obviously, x ≠ x , otherwise the line
1 2
will become perpendicular to x-axis and its
slope will not be defined. The inclination of
the line l may be acute or obtuse. Let us
take these two cases.
Draw perpendicular QR to x-axis and
PM perpendicular to RQ as shown in
Figs. 9.3 (i) and (ii).
Fig 9. 3 (i)
Case 1 When angle θ is acute:
In Fig 9.3 (i), ∠MPQ = θ. ... (1)
Therefore, slope of line l = m = tan θ.
MQ y - y
But in ∆MPQ, we have tanθ= = 2 1. ... (2)
MP x - x

2024-25154 MATHEMATICS
From equations (1) and (2), we have
y - y
m= 2 1.
x - x
2 1
Case II When angle θ is obtuse:
In Fig 9.3 (ii), we have
∠MPQ = 180° – θ.
Therefore, θ = 180° – ∠MPQ.
Now, slope of the line l
Fig 9. 3 (ii)
m = tan θ
=tan ( 180° – ∠MPQ) = – tan ∠MPQ
MQ y −y y −y
= − =− 2 1 = 2 1.
MP x 1−x 2 x 2−x 1
Consequently, we see that in both the cases the slope m of the line through the points
y - y
(x , y ) and (x , y ) is given by m= 2 1 .

9.2.2 Conditions for parallelism and perpendicularity of lines in terms of their
slopes In a coordinate plane, suppose that non-vertical lines l and l have slopes m
1 2 1
and m , respectively. Let their inclinations be α and
2
β, respectively.
If the line l is parallel to l (Fig 9.4), then their
1 2
inclinations are equal, i.e.,
α = β, and hence, tan α = tan β
Therefore m = m , i.e., their slopes are equal.
1 2
Conversely, if the slope of two lines l and l
1 2
is same, i.e.,
m = m .
1 2 Fig 9. 4
Then tan α = tan β.
By the property of tangent function (between 0° and 180°), α = β.
Therefore, the lines are parallel.
2024-25STRAIGHT LINES 155
Hence, two non vertical lines l and l are parallel if and only if their slopes
1 2
are equal.
If the lines l and l are perpendicular (Fig 9.5), then β = α + 90°.
1 2
Therefore, tan β = tan (α + 90°)

-
=– cot α =

i.e., m = or m m = – 1
2 m 1 2

Conversely, if m m = – 1, i.e., tan α tan β = – 1.
1 2
Then tan α = – cot β = tan (β + 90°) or tan (β – 90°)
Fig 9. 5
Therefore, α and β differ by 90°.
Thus, lines l and l are perpendicular to each other.
1 2
Hence, two non-vertical lines are perpendicular to each other if and only if
their slopes are negative reciprocals of each other,

i.e., m = - or, m m = – 1.

Let us consider the following example.
Example 1 Find the slope of the lines:
(a) Passing through the points (3, – 2) and (–1, 4),
(b) Passing through the points (3, – 2) and (7, – 2),
(c) Passing through the points (3, – 2) and (3, 4),
(d) Making inclination of 60° with the positive direction of x-axis.

4−(−2) 6 3

(c) The slope of the line through the points (3, – 2) and (3, 4) is
2024-25156 MATHEMATICS
4 – (–2) 6
m = = , which is not defined.
3 – 3 0
(d) Here inclination of the line α = 60°. Therefore, slope of the line is
m = tan 60° = 3.
9.2.3 Angle between two lines When we think about more than one line in a plane,
then we find that these lines are either intersecting or parallel. Here we will discuss the
angle between two lines in terms of their slopes.
Let L and L be two non-vertical lines with slopes m and m ,respectively. If α
1 2 1 2 1
and α are the inclinations of lines L and L , respectively. Then
2 1 2
m = tanα and m = tanα .
1 1 2 2
We know that when two lines intersect each other, they make two pairs of
vertically opposite angles such that sum of any two adjacent angles is 180°. Let θ and
φ be the adjacent angles between the lines L and L (Fig 9.6). Then
1 2
θ = α – α and α , α ≠ 90°.
2 1 1 2

Therefore tan θ = tan (α – α ) = 2 1 = 2 1 (as 1 + m m ≠ 0)

Now, there arise two cases:

Case I If is positive, then tan θ will be positive and tan φ will be negative,
1+m m

which means θ will be acute and φ will be obtuse.
m – m
2 1
Case II If is negative, then tan θ will be negative and tan φ will be positive,
1+m m
1 2
which means that θ will be obtuse and φ will be acute.
Thus, the acute angle (say θ) between lines L and L with slopes m and m ,
1 2 1 2
respectively, is given by
m −m
tanθ = 1+2

The obtuse angle (say φ) can be found by using φ =1800 – θ.

9.3 Various Forms of the Equation of a Line
We know that every line in a plane contains infinitely many points on it. This relationship
between line and points leads us to find the solution of the following problem:
How can we say that a given point lies on the given line? Its answer may be that
for a given line we should have a definite condition on the points lying on the line.
Suppose P (x, y) is an arbitrary point in the XY-plane and L is the given line. For the
equation of L, we wish to construct a statement or condition for the point P that is
true, when P is on L, otherwise false. Of course the statement is merely an algebraic
equation involving the variables x and y. Now, we will discuss the equation of a line
under different conditions.
9.3.1 Horizontal and vertical lines If a horizontal line L is at a distance a from the x-
axis then ordinate of every point lying on the line is either a or – a [Fig 9.8 (a)].
Therefore, equation of the line L is either y = a or y = – a. Choice of sign will depend
upon the position of the line according as the line is above or below the y-axis. Similarly,
the equation of a vertical line at a distance b from the y-axis is either x = b or
x = – b [Fig 9.8(b)].
2024-25160 MATHEMATICS
Fig 9.8
Example 4 Find the equations of the lines
parallel to axes and passing through
(– 2, 3).
Solution Position of the lines is shown in the
Fig 9.9. The y-coordinate of every point on the
line parallel to x-axis is 3, therefore, equation
of the line parallel tox-axis and passing through
(– 2, 3) is y = 3. Similarly, equation of the line
parallel to y-axis and passing through (– 2, 3)
is x = – 2.
Fig 9.9
9.3.2 Point-slope form Suppose that
P (x , y ) is a fixed point on a non-vertical
0 0 0
line L, whose slope is m. Let P (x, y) be an
arbitrary point on L (Fig 9.10).
Then, by the definition, the slope of L is given
by
y− y
m = 0, i.e., y− y = m(x− x )
x− x 0 0
0
...(1)
Since the point P (x , y ) along with
0 0 0
all points (x, y) on L satisfies (1) and no other
point in the plane satisfies (1). Equation (1)
Fig 9.10
is indeed the equation for the given line L.
2024-25STRAIGHT LINES 161
Thus, the point (x, y) lies on the line with slope m through the fixed point (x , y ),
0 0
if and only if, its coordinates satisfy the equation
y – y = m (x – x )
0 0
Example 5 Find the equation of the line through (– 2, 3) with slope – 4.
Solution Here m = – 4 and given point (x , y ) is (– 2, 3).
0 0
By slope-intercept form formula
(1) above, equation of the given
line is
y – 3 = – 4 (x + 2) or
4x + y + 5 = 0, which is the
required equation.
9.3.3 Two-point form Let the
line L passes through two given
points P (x , y ) and P (x , y ).
1 1 1 2 2 2
Let P (x, y) be a general point
on L (Fig 9.11).
The three points P , P and P are Fig 9.11

collinear, therefore, we have
slope of P P = slope of P P

Example 6 Write the equation of the line through the points (1, –1) and (3, 5).

1 1 2 2
for the equation of the line, we have
( )
( ) 5– –1 ( )
y – –1 = x –1
3–1
or –3x + y + 4 = 0, which is the required equation.
9.3.4 Slope-intercept form Sometimes a line is known to us with its slope and an
intercept on one of the axes. We will now find equations of such lines.
2024-25162 MATHEMATICS
Case I Suppose a line L with slope m cuts
the y-axis at a distance c from the origin
(Fig 9.12). The distance c is called the y-
intercept of the line L. Obviously,
coordinates of the point where the line meet
the y-axis are (0, c). Thus, L has slope m
and passes through a fixed point (0, c).
Therefore, by point-slope form, the equation
of L is
y- c= m(x- 0) or =y m+x c Fig 9.12
Thus, the point (x, y) on the line with slope m and y-intercept c lies on the line if and
only if
y = mx +c ...(3)
Note that the value of c will be positive or negative according as the intercept is made
on the positive or negative side of the y-axis, respectively.
Case II Suppose line L with slope m makes x-intercept d. Then equation of L is
y = m(x – d) ... (4)
Students may derive this equation themselves by the same method as in Case I.

Example 7 Write the equation of the lines for which tan θ = , where θ is the
2
3
inclination of the line and (i) y-intercept is – (ii) x-intercept is 4.
2
1 3
Solution (i) Here, slope of the line is m = tan θ = and y - intercept c = – .
2 2
Therefore, by slope-intercept form (3) above, the equation of the line is
1 3
y = x− or 2y− x+3= 0,
2 2
which is the required equation.
1
(ii) Here, we have m = tan θ = and d = 4.
2
Therefore, by slope-intercept form (4) above, the equation of the line is
1
y = (x−4) or 2y− x+4 = 0,
2
which is the required equation.
2024-25STRAIGHT LINES 163
9.3.5 Intercept - form Suppose a line L makes x-intercept a and y-intercept b on the
axes. Obviously L meets x-axis at the point
(a, 0) and y-axis at the point (0, b) (Fig .9.13).
By two-point form of the equation of the line,
we have
b−0
y−0= (x−a) or ay=−bx+ab ,
0−a
x y
i.e., + =1.
a b
Thus, equation of the line making intercepts
Fig 9.13
a and b on x-and y-axis, respectively, is
x y
+ =1 ... (5)
a b
Example 8 Find the equation of the line, which makes intercepts –3 and 2 on the
x- and y-axes respectively.
Solution Here a = –3 and b = 2. By intercept form (5) above, equation of the line is
x y
+ =1 or 2x−3y+6=0.
−3 2
Any equation of the form Ax + By + C = 0, where A and B are not zero simultaneously
is called general linear equation or general equation of a line.

9.4 Distance of a Point From a Line
The distance of a point from a line is the length of the perpendicular drawn from the
point to the line. Let L : Ax + By + C = 0 be a line, whose distance from the point

Example 11 If the lines 2x+ y- 3= 0, 5x+ ky- =3 0 and 3x- y- =2 0are
concurrent, find the value of k.
Solution Three lines are said to be concurrent, if they pass through a common point,
i.e., point of intersection of any two lines lies on the third line. Here given lines are
2x + y – 3 = 0 ... (1)
5x + ky – 3 = 0 ... (2)

Example 12 Find the distance of the line 4x – y = 0 from the point P (4, 1) measured
along the line making an angle of 135° with the positive x-axis.
Solution Given line is 4x – y = 0 ... (1)
In order to find the distance of the
line (1) from the point P (4, 1) along
another line, we have to find the point
of intersection of both the lines. For
(1, 4)
this purpose, we will first find the
equation of the second line
(Fig 9.16). Slope of second line is
tan 135° = –1. Equation of the line
with slope – 1 through the point
P (4, 1) is
Fig 9.16
y – 1 = – 1 (x – 4) or x + y – 5 = 0 ... (2)
Solving (1) and (2), we get x = 1 and y = 4 so that point of intersection of the two lines
is Q (1, 4). Now, distance of line (1) from the point P (4, 1) along the line (2)
= the distance between the points P (4, 1) and Q (1, 4).

Example 16 Show that the path of a moving point such that its distances from two

Solution Given lines are
3x – 2y = 5 … (1)
and 3x + 2y = 5 … (2)
Let (h, k) is any point, whose distances from the lines (1) and (2) are equal. Therefore
3h−2k −5 3h+2k −5
