NTRODUCTION
In Chapter 4, we learnt that an electric current produces magnetic field
and that two current-carrying wires exert a magnetic force on each other.
Further, in Chapter 6, we have seen that a magnetic field changing with
time gives rise to an electric field. Is the converse also true? Does an
electric field changing with time give rise to a magnetic field? James Clerk
Maxwell (1831-1879), argued that this was indeed the case – not only
an electric current but also a time-varying electric field generates magnetic
field. While applying the Ampere’s circuital law to find magnetic field at a
point outside a capacitor connected to a time-varying current, Maxwell
noticed an inconsistency in the Ampere’s circuital law. He suggested the
existence of an additional current, called by him, the displacement
current to remove this inconsistency.
Maxwell formulated a set of equations involving electric and magnetic
fields, and their sources, the charge and current densities. These
equations are known as Maxwell’s equations. Together with the Lorentz
force formula (Chapter 4), they mathematically express all the basic laws
of electromagnetism.
The most important prediction to emerge from Maxwell’s equations
is the existence of electromagnetic waves, which are (coupled) time-
varying electric and magnetic fields that propagate in space. The speed
of the waves, according to these equations, turned out to be very close to
2024-25Physics
the speed of light( 3 ×108 m/s), obtained from optical
measurements. This led to the remarkable conclusion
that light is an electromagnetic wave. Maxwell’s work
thus unified the domain of electricity, magnetism and
light. Hertz, in 1885, experimentally demonstrated the
existence of electromagnetic waves. Its technological use
by Marconi and others led in due course to the
revolution in communication that we are witnessing
today.
In this chapter, we first discuss the need for
displacement current and its consequences. Then we
present a descriptive account of electromagnetic waves.
The broad spectrum of electromagnetic waves,
stretching from g rays (wavelength ~10–12 m) to long
radio waves (wavelength ~106 m) is described.

We have seen in Chapter 4 that an electrical current
produces a magnetic field around it. Maxwell showed
that for logical consistency, a changing electric field must
also produce a magnetic field. This effect is of great
importance because it explains the existence of radio
waves, gamma rays and visible light, as well as all other
forms of electromagnetic waves.
To see how a changing electric field gives rise to
a magnetic field, let us consider the process of
charging of a capacitor and apply Ampere’s circuital
law given by (Chapter 4)
“B.dl = m i (t) (8.1)
0
to find magnetic field at a point outside the capacitor.
Figure 8.1(a) shows a parallel plate capacitor C which
is a part of circuit through which a time-dependent
current i (t) flows . Let us find the magnetic field at a
point such as P, in a region outside the parallel plate
capacitor. For this, we consider a plane circular loop of
radius r whose plane is perpendicular to the direction
of the current-carrying wire, and which is centred
symmetrically with respect to the wire [Fig. 8.1(a)]. From
symmetry, the magnetic field is directed along the
circumference of the circular loop and is the same in
magnitude at all points on the loop so that if B is the
magnitude of the field, the left side of Eq. (8.1) is B (2p r).

James Clerk Maxwell
(1831 – 1879) Born in
Edinburgh, Scotland,
was among the greatest
physicists of the
nineteenth century. He
derived the thermal
velocity distribution of
molecules in a gas and
was among the first to
obtain reliable
estimates of molecular
parameters from
measurable quantities
like viscosity, etc.
Maxwell’s greatest
acheivement was the
unification of the laws of
electricity and
magnetism (discovered
by Coulomb, Oersted,
Ampere and Faraday)
into a consistent set of
equations now called
Maxwell’s equations.
From these he arrived at
the most important
conclusion that light is
an electromagnetic
wave. Interestingly,
Maxwell did not agree
with the idea (strongly
suggested by the
Faraday’s laws of
electrolysis) that
electricity was
particulate in nature.

Now, consider a different surface, which has the same boundary. This
is a pot like surface [Fig. 8.1(b)] which nowhere touches the current, but
has its bottom between the capacitor plates; its mouth is the circular
loop mentioned above. Another such surface is shaped like a tiffin box
(without the lid) [Fig. 8.1(c)]. On applying Ampere’s circuital law to such
surfaces with the same perimeter, we find that the left hand side of
Eq. (8.1) has not changed but the right hand side is zero and not m i,
0
since no current passes through the surface of Fig. 8.1(b) and (c). So we
have a contradiction; calculated one way, there is a magnetic field at a
point P; calculated another way, the magnetic field at P is zero.
Since the contradiction arises from our use of Ampere’s circuital law,
this law must be missing something. The missing term must be such
that one gets the same magnetic field at point P, no matter what surface
is used.
We can actually guess the missing term by looking carefully at
Fig. 8.1(c). Is there anything passing through the surface S between the
plates of the capacitor? Yes, of course, the electric field! If the plates of the
capacitor have an area A, and a total charge Q, the magnitude of the
electric field E between the plates is (Q/A)/e (see Eq. 2.41). The field is
0
perpendicular to the surface S of Fig. 8.1(c). It has the same magnitude
over the area A of the capacitor plates, and vanishes outside it. So what
is the electric flux F through the surface S ? Using Gauss’s law, it is

The generalisation made by Maxwell then is the following. The source

precisely, the total current i is the sum of the conduction current

The generalised (and correct) Ampere’s circuital law has the same
form as Eq. (8.1), with one difference: “the total current passing
through any surface of which the closed loop is the perimeter” is
the sum of the conduction current and the displacement current.
The generalised law is

and is known as Ampere-Maxwell law.
In all respects, the displacement current has the same physical
effects as the conduction current. In some cases, for example, steady
electric fields in a conducting wire, the displacement current may
be zero since the electric field E does not change with time. In other
FIGURE 8.2 (a) The cases, for example, the charging capacitor above, both conduction

fields E and B between space. In most of the cases, they both may be present in the same

of space where there is no conduction current, but there is only a
displacement current due to time-varying electric fields. In such a
region, we expect a magnetic field, though there is no (conduction)
current source nearby! The prediction of such a displacement current
can be verified experimentally. For example, a magnetic field (say at point
M) between the plates of the capacitor in Fig. 8.2(a) can be measured and
is seen to be the same as that just outside (at P).
The displacement current has (literally) far reaching consequences.
One thing we immediately notice is that the laws of electricity and
magnetism are now more symmetrical*. Faraday’s law of induction states
that there is an induced emf equal to the rate of change of magnetic flux.
Now, since the emf between two points 1 and 2 is the work done per unit
charge in taking it from 1 to 2, the existence of an emf implies the existence
of an electric field. So, we can rephrase Faraday’s law of electromagnetic
induction by saying that a magnetic field, changing with time, gives rise
to an electric field. Then, the fact that an electric field changing with
time gives rise to a magnetic field, is the symmetrical counterpart, and is

field (magnetic monopoles) analogous to electric charges which are sources of

electric field.

Waves
a consequence of the displacement current being a source of a magnetic
field. Thus, time- dependent electric and magnetic fields give rise to each
other! Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction and Ampere-Maxwell
law give a quantitative expression of this statement, with the current
being the total current, as in Eq. (8.5). One very important consequence
of this symmetry is the existence of electromagnetic waves, which we
discuss qualitatively in the next section.

8.3.1 Sources of electromagnetic waves
How are electromagnetic waves produced? Neither stationary charges
nor charges in uniform motion (steady currents) can be sources of
electromagnetic waves. The former produces only electrostatic fields, while
the latter produces magnetic fields that, however, do not vary with time.
It is an important result of Maxwell’s theory that accelerated charges
radiate electromagnetic waves. The proof of this basic result is beyond
the scope of this book, but we can accept it on the basis of rough,
qualitative reasoning. Consider a charge oscillating with some frequency.
(An oscillating charge is an example of accelerating charge.) This
produces an oscillating electric field in space, which produces an
oscillating magnetic field, which in turn, is a source of oscillating electric
field, and so on. The oscillating electric and magnetic fields thus
regenerate each other, so to speak, as the wave propagates through the
space. The frequency of the electromagnetic wave naturally equals the
frequency of oscillation of the charge. The energy associated with the
propagating wave comes at the expense of the energy of the source – the
accelerated charge.
From the preceding discussion, it might appear easy to test the
prediction that light is an electromagnetic wave. We might think that all
we needed to do was to set up an ac circuit in which the current oscillate
at the frequency of visible light, say, yellow light. But, alas, that is not
possible. The frequency of yellow light is about 6 × 1014 Hz, while the
frequency that we get even with modern electronic circuits is hardly about
1011 Hz. This is why the experimental demonstration of electromagnetic 205
2024-25Physics
wave had to come in the low frequency region (the radio
wave region), as in the Hertz’s experiment (1887).
Hertz’s successful experimental test of Maxwell’s
theory created a sensation and sparked off other
important works in this field. Two important
achievements in this connection deserve mention. Seven
years after Hertz, Jagdish Chandra Bose, working at
Calcutta (now Kolkata), succeeded in producing and
observing electromagnetic waves of much shorter
wavelength (25 mm to 5 mm). His experiment, like that
of Hertz’s, was confined to the laboratory.
At around the same time, Guglielmo Marconi in Italy
followed Hertz’s work and succeeded in transmitting
electromagnetic waves over distances of many kilometres.
Marconi’s experiment marks the beginning of the field of
communication using electromagnetic waves.
8.3.2 Nature of electromagnetic waves
It can be shown from Maxwell’s equations that electric
and magnetic fields in an electromagnetic wave are
perpendicular to each other, and to the direction of
propagation. It appears reasonable, say from our
discussion of the displacement current. Consider
Fig. 8.2. The electric field inside the plates of the capacitor
is directed perpendicular to the plates. The magnetic
field this gives rise to via the displacement current is
along the perimeter of a circle parallel to the capacitor
plates. So B and E are perpendicular in this case. This
is a general feature.
In Fig. 8.3, we show a typical example of a plane
electromagnetic wave propagating along the z direction
(the fields are shown as a function of the z coordinate, at
a given time t). The electric field E is along the x-axis,
x
and varies sinusoidally with z, at a given time. The
magnetic field B is along the y-axis, and again varies
y
sinusoidally with z. The electric and magnetic fields E
x
and B are perpendicular to each
y
other, and to the direction z of
propagation. We can write E and
x
B as follows:
y
E = E sin (kz–wt) [8.7(a)]
x 0
B = B sin (kz–wt) [8.7(b)]

and ω is the angular frequency. k is the magnitude of the wave vector (or
propagation vector) k and its direction describes the direction of
propagation of the wave. The speed of propagation of the wave is (ω/k).

in terms of frequency, ν (=ω/2π) and wavelength, λ (=2π/k) as

It is also seen from Maxwell’s equations that the magnitude of the
electric and the magnetic fields in an electromagnetic wave are related as
B = (E /c) (8.10)
0 0
We here make remarks on some features of electromagnetic waves.
They are self-sustaining oscillations of electric and magnetic fields in
free space, or vacuum. They differ from all the other waves we have
studied so far, in respect that no material medium is involved in the
vibrations of the electric and magnetic fields.
But what if a material medium is actually there? We know that light,
an electromagnetic wave, does propagate through glass, for example. We
have seen earlier that the total electric and magnetic fields inside a
medium are described in terms of a permittivity ε and a magnetic
permeability µ (these describe the factors by which the total fields differ
from the external fields). These replace ε and µ in the description to
0 0
electric and magnetic fields in Maxwell’s equations with the result that in
a material medium of permittivity ε and magnetic permeability µ, the
velocity of light becomes,
1
v =
me (8.11)
Thus, the velocity of light depends on electric and magnetic properties of
the medium. We shall see in the next chapter that the refractive index of
one medium with respect to the other is equal to the ratio of velocities of
light in the two media.
The velocity of electromagnetic waves in free space or vacuum is an
important fundamental constant. It has been shown by experiments on
electromagnetic waves of different wavelengths that this velocity is the
same (independent of wavelength) to within a few metres per second, out
of a value of 3×108 m/s. The constancy of the velocity of em waves in
vacuum is so strongly supported by experiments and the actual value is
so well known now that this is used to define a standard of length.
The great technological importance of electromagnetic waves stems
from their capability to carry energy from one place to another. The
radio and TV signals from broadcasting stations carry energy. Light
carries energy from the sun to the earth, thus making life possible on
the earth. 207

perpendicular to both x- and y-axes. Using vector algebra, E × B should
be along x-direction. Since, (+ˆ j) × (+kˆ ) = ˆ i, B is along the z-direction.
Thus, B = 2.1 × 10–8 kˆ T

LECTROMAGNETIC PECTRUM
At the time Maxwell predicted the existence of electromagnetic waves, the
only familiar electromagnetic waves were the visible light waves. The existence
of ultraviolet and infrared waves was barely established. By the end of the
nineteenth century, X-rays and gamma rays had also been discovered. We
now know that, electromagnetic waves include visible light waves, X-rays,
gamma rays, radio waves, microwaves, ultraviolet and infrared waves. The
classification of em waves according to frequency is the electromagnetic
spectrum (Fig. 8.4). There is no sharp division between one kind of wave
and the next. The classification is based roughly on how the waves are
produced and/or detected.
We briefly describe these different types of electromagnetic waves, in
order of decreasing wavelengths.

FIGURE 8.4 The electromagnetic spectrum, with common names for various
part of it. The various regions do not have sharply defined boundaries.
8.4.1 Radio waves
Radio waves are produced by the accelerated motion of charges in conducting
wires. They are used in radio and television communication systems. They
are generally in the frequency range from 500 kHz to about 1000 MHz.
The AM (amplitude modulated) band is from 530 kHz to 1710 kHz. Higher
frequencies upto 54 MHz are used for short wave bands. TV waves range
from 54 MHz to 890 MHz. The FM (frequency modulated) radio band
extends from 88 MHz to 108 MHz. Cellular phones use radio waves to
transmit voice communication in the ultrahigh frequency (UHF) band. How
these waves are transmitted and received is described in Chapter 15.
8.4.2 Microwaves
Microwaves (short-wavelength radio waves), with frequencies in the
gigahertz (GHz) range, are produced by special vacuum tubes (called
klystrons, magnetrons and Gunn diodes). Due to their short wavelengths,
they are suitable for the radar systems used in aircraft navigation. Radar
also provides the basis for the speed guns used to time fast balls, tennis-
serves, and automobiles. Microwave ovens are an interesting domestic
application of these waves. In such ovens, the frequency of the microwaves
is selected to match the resonant frequency of water molecules so that
energy from the waves is transferred efficiently to the kinetic energy of
209
the molecules. This raises the temperature of any food containing water.
2024-25Physics
8.4.3 Infrared waves
Infrared waves are produced by hot bodies and molecules. This band
lies adjacent to the low-frequency or long-wave length end of the visible
spectrum. Infrared waves are sometimes referred to as heat waves. This
is because water molecules present in most materials readily absorb
infrared waves (many other molecules, for example, CO , NH , also absorb
2 3
infrared waves). After absorption, their thermal motion increases, that is,
they heat up and heat their surroundings. Infrared lamps are used in
physical therapy. Infrared radiation also plays an important role in
maintaining the earth’s warmth or average temperature through the
greenhouse effect. Incoming visible light (which passes relatively easily
through the atmosphere) is absorbed by the earth’s surface and re-
radiated as infrared (longer wavelength) radiations. This radiation is
trapped by greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and water vapour.
Infrared detectors are used in Earth satellites, both for military purposes
and to observe growth of crops. Electronic devices (for example
semiconductor light emitting diodes) also emit infrared and are widely
used in the remote switches of household electronic systems such as TV
sets, video recorders and hi-fi systems.
8.4.4 Visible rays
It is the most familiar form of electromagnetic waves. It is the part of the
spectrum that is detected by the human eye. It runs from about
4 × 1014 Hz to about 7 × 1014Hz or a wavelength range of about 700 –
400 nm. Visible light emitted or reflected from objects around us provides
us information about the world. Our eyes are sensitive to this range of
wavelengths. Different animals are sensitive to different range of
wavelengths. For example, snakes can detect infrared waves, and the
‘visible’ range of many insects extends well into the utraviolet.
8.4.5 Ultraviolet rays
It covers wavelengths ranging from about 4 × 10–7 m (400 nm) down to
6 × 10–10m (0.6 nm). Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is produced by special
lamps and very hot bodies. The sun is an important source of ultraviolet
light. But fortunately, most of it is absorbed in the ozone layer in the
atmosphere at an altitude of about 40 – 50 km. UV light in large quantities
has harmful effects on humans. Exposure to UV radiation induces the
production of more melanin, causing tanning of the skin. UV radiation is
absorbed by ordinary glass. Hence, one cannot get tanned or sunburn
through glass windows.
Welders wear special glass goggles or face masks with glass windows
to protect their eyes from large amount of UV produced by welding arcs.
Due to its shorter wavelengths, UV radiations can be focussed into very
narrow beams for high precision applications such as LASIK (Laser-
assisted in situ keratomileusis) eye surgery. UV lamps are used to kill
germs in water purifiers.
Ozone layer in the atmosphere plays a protective role, and hence its
depletion by chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) gas (such as freon) is a matter
210
of international concern.
2024-25Electromagnetic
Waves
8.4.6 X-rays
Beyond the UV region of the electromagnetic spectrum lies the X-ray
region. We are familiar with X-rays because of its medical applications. It
covers wavelengths from about 10–8 m (10 nm) down to 10–13 m
(10–4 nm). One common way to generate X-rays is to bombard a metal
target by high energy electrons. X-rays are used as a diagnostic tool in
medicine and as a treatment for certain forms of cancer. Because X-rays
damage or destroy living tissues and organisms, care must be taken to
avoid unnecessary or over exposure.
8.4.7 Gamma rays
They lie in the upper frequency range of the electromagnetic spectrum
and have wavelengths of from about 10–10m to less than 10–14m. This
high frequency radiation is produced in nuclear reactions and
also emitted by radioactive nuclei. They are used in medicine to destroy
cancer cells.
Table 8.1 summarises different types of electromagnetic waves, their
production and detections. As mentioned earlier, the demarcation between
different regions is not sharp and there are overlaps.

SUMMARY
1. Maxwell found an inconsistency in the Ampere’s law and suggested the
existence of an additional current, called displacement current, to remove
this inconsistency. This displacement current is due to time-varying electric
field and is given by
dF
i = e E
d 0 dt
and acts as a source of magnetic field in exactly the same way as conduction
current.
2. An accelerating charge produces electromagnetic waves. An electric charge
oscillating harmonically with frequency n, produces electromagnetic waves
of the same frequency n. An electric dipole is a basic source of
electromagnetic waves.
3. Electromagnetic waves with wavelength of the order of a few metres were
first produced and detected in the laboratory by Hertz in 1887. He thus
verified a basic prediction of Maxwell’s equations.
4. Electric and magnetic fields oscillate sinusoidally in space and time in an
electromagnetic wave. The oscillating electric and magnetic fields, E and
B are perpendicular to each other, and to the direction of propagation of
the electromagnetic wave. For a wave of frequency n, wavelength l,
propagating along z-direction, we have

5. The speed c of electromagnetic wave in vacuum is related to m and e (the
0 0
free space permeability and permittivity constants) as follows:
c =1/ me . The value of c equals the speed of light obtained from
0 0
optical measurements.
Light is an electromagnetic wave; c is, therefore, also the speed of light.
Electromagnetic waves other than light also have the same velocity c in
free space.
The speed of light, or of electromagnetic waves in a material medium is
given by v =1/ me
where m is the permeability of the medium and e its permittivity.
6. The spectrum of electromagnetic waves stretches, in principle, over an
infinite range of wavelengths. Different regions are known by different
names; g-rays, X-rays, ultraviolet rays, visible rays, infrared rays,
–2
microwaves and radio waves in order of increasing wavelength from 10 Å
or 10–12 m to 106 m.
They interact with matter via their electric and magnetic fields which set
in oscillation charges present in all matter. The detailed interaction and
so the mechanism of absorption, scattering, etc., depend on the wavelength
of the electromagnetic wave, and the nature of the atoms and molecules
212 in the medium.

POINTS TO PONDER
1. The basic difference between various types of electromagnetic waves
lies in their wavelengths or frequencies since all of them travel through
vacuum with the same speed. Consequently, the waves differ
considerably in their mode of interaction with matter.
2. Accelerated charged particles radiate electromagnetic waves. The
wavelength of the electromagnetic wave is often correlated with the
characteristic size of the system that radiates. Thus, gamma radiation,
having wavelength of 10–14 m to 10–15 m, typically originate from an
atomic nucleus. X-rays are emitted from heavy atoms. Radio waves
are produced by accelerating electrons in a circuit. A transmitting
antenna can most efficiently radiate waves having a wavelength of
about the same size as the antenna. Visible radiation emitted by atoms
is, however, much longer in wavelength than atomic size.
3. Infrared waves, with frequencies lower than those of visible light,
vibrate not only the electrons, but entire atoms or molecules of a
substance. This vibration increases the internal energy and
consequently, the temperature of the substance. This is why infrared
waves are often called heat waves.
4. The centre of sensitivity of our eyes coincides with the centre of the
wavelength distribution of the sun. It is because humans have evolved
with visions most sensitive to the strongest wavelengths from
the sun.
