7.1 Introduction
Differential Calculus is centred on the concept of the
derivative. The original motivation for the derivative was
the problem of defining tangent lines to the graphs of
functions and calculating the slope of such lines. Integral
Calculus is motivated by the problem of defining and
calculating the area of the region bounded by the graph of
the functions.
If a function f is differentiable in an interval I, i.e., its
derivative f ′exists at each point of I, then a natural question
arises that given f ′at each point of I, can we determine
the function? The functions that could possibly have given
function as a derivative are called anti derivatives (or G .W. Leibnitz
primitive) of the function. Further, the formula that gives (1646-1716)
all these anti derivatives is called the indefinite integral of the function and such
process of finding anti derivatives is called integration. Such type of problems arise in
many practical situations. For instance, if we know the instantaneous velocity of an
object at any instant, then there arises a natural question, i.e., can we determine the
position of the object at any instant? There are several such practical and theoretical
situations where the process of integration is involved. The development of integral
calculus arises out of the efforts of solving the problems of the following types:
(a) the problem of finding a function whenever its derivative is given,
(b) the problem of finding the area bounded by the graph of a function under certain
conditions.
These two problems lead to the two forms of the integrals, e.g., indefinite and
definite integrals, which together constitute the Integral Calculus.

There is a connection, known as the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, between
indefinite integral and definite integral which makes the definite integral as a practical
tool for science and engineering. The definite integral is also used to solve many interesting
problems from various disciplines like economics, finance and probability.
In this Chapter, we shall confine ourselves to the study of indefinite and definite
integrals and their elementary properties including some techniques of integration.
7.2 Integration as an Inverse Process of Differentiation
Integration is the inverse process of differentiation. Instead of differentiating a function,
we are given the derivative of a function and asked to find its primitive, i.e., the original
function. Such a process is called integration or anti differentiation.
Let us consider the following examples:
d
We know that (sin x) = cos x ... (1)
dx
d x3
( ) = x2 ... (2)
dx 3
d
and (ex)=ex ... (3)
dx
We observe that in (1), the function cos x is the derived function of sin x. We say
x3
that sin x is an anti derivative (or an integral) of cos x. Similarly, in (2) and (3), and
3
ex are the anti derivatives (or integrals) of x2 and ex, respectively. Again, we note that
for any real number C, treated as constant function, its derivative is zero and hence, we
can write (1), (2) and (3) as follows :
d d x3 d
(sin x+C)=cosx, ( +C)=x2and (ex +C)=ex
dx dx 3 dx
Thus, anti derivatives (or integrals) of the above cited functions are not unique.
Actually, there exist infinitely many anti derivatives of each of these functions which
can be obtained by choosing C arbitrarily from the set of real numbers. For this reason
C is customarily referred to as arbitrary constant. In fact, C is the parameter by
varying which one gets different anti derivatives (or integrals) of the given function.
d
More generally, if there is a function F such that F(x)= f (x), ∀x ∈ I (interval),
dx
then for any arbitrary real number C, (also called constant of integration)
d
[F(x)+C] = f(x), x ∈ I
dx
Rationalised 2023-24INTEGRALS 227
Thus, {F + C, C ∈ R} denotes a family of anti derivatives of f.
Remark Functions with same derivatives differ by a constant. To show this, let g and h
be two functions having the same derivatives on an interval I.
Consider the function f = g – h defined by f(x) = g(x) – h(x), ∀x ∈ I
df
Then =f′ = g′ – h′ giving f′ (x) = g′ (x) – h′ (x) ∀x ∈ I
dx
or f′ (x) = 0, ∀x ∈ I by hypothesis,
i.e., the rate of change of f with respect to x is zero on I and hence f is constant.
In view of the above remark, it is justified to infer that the family {F + C, C ∈ R}
provides all possible anti derivatives of f.
We introduce a new symbol, namely, ∫ f(x)dx which will represent the entire
class of anti derivatives read as the indefinite integral of f with respect to x.
Symbolically, we write ∫ f(x)dx=F(x)+C.
dy
Notation Given that = f (x), we write y = ∫ f (x)dx.

We already know the formulae for the derivatives of many important functions.
From these formulae, we can write down immediately the corresponding formulae

7.2.1 Some properties of indefinite integral
In this sub section, we shall derive some properties of indefinite integrals.
(I) The process of differentiation and integration are inverses of each other in the
sense of the following results :
d
∫ f(x)dx = f(x)
dx
and ∫ f′(x)dx = f(x) + C, where C is any arbitrary constant.
Proof Let F be any anti derivative of f, i.e.,
d
F(x) = f(x)
dx
Then ∫ f(x)dx = F(x) + C
d d
Therefore ∫ f(x)dx = (F(x)+C)
dx dx
d
= F(x)= f(x)
dx
Similarly, we note that
d
f′(x) = f(x)
dx
and hence ∫ f′(x)dx = f(x) + C
where C is arbitrary constant called constant of integration.
(II) Two indefinite integrals with the same derivative lead to the same family of
curves and so they are equivalent.
Rationalised 2023-24230 MATHEMATICS
Proof Let f and g be two functions such that
d d
∫ f(x)dx = ∫g(x)dx
dx dx
d
or
∫ f(x)dx–∫g(x)dx
= 0
 
dx
Hence ∫ f(x)dx –∫g(x)dx= C, where C is any real number (Why?)
or ∫ f(x)dx = ∫g(x)dx+C
So the families of curves
{∫
f(x)dx+C ,C
∈R}
1 1
and
{∫g(x)dx+C
,C
∈R}
are identical.
2 2
Hence, in this sense, ∫ f(x)dxand∫g(x)dx are equivalent.
A
Note The equivalence of the families
{∫
f(x)dx+C ,C
∈R}
and
1 1
{∫g(x)dx+C
,C
∈R}
is customarily expressed by writing ∫ f(x)dx=∫g(x)dx,
2 2
without mentioning the parameter.
(III)
∫[f(x)+g(x)]dx=∫ f(x)dx+∫g(x)dx
Proof By Property (I), we have
d
∫[ f(x)+g(x)]dx
= f(x) + g(x) ... (1)
 
dx
On the otherhand, we find that
d d d
∫ f(x)dx+∫g(x)dx = ∫ f(x)dx+ ∫g(x)dx
 
dx dx dx
=f(x) + g(x) ... (2)
Thus, in view of Property (II), it follows by (1) and (2) that
∫( f(x)+ g(x))dx= ∫ f(x)dx+∫g(x)dx.
(IV) For any real number k, ∫k f(x)dx=k ∫ f(x)dx
Rationalised 2023-24INTEGRALS 231
d
Proof By the Property (I), ∫k f(x)dx=k f(x).
dx
d d
Also  k ∫ f(x)dx = k ∫ f(x)dx=k f(x)
 
dx dx
Therefore, using the Property (II), we have ∫k f(x)dx=k ∫ f(x)dx.
(V) Properties (III) and (IV) can be generalised to a finite number of functions
f , f , ..., f and the real numbers, k , k , ..., k giving

To find an anti derivative of a given function, we search intuitively for a function
whose derivative is the given function. The search for the requisite function for finding
an anti derivative is known as integration by the method of inspection. We illustrate it
through some examples.
Example 1 Write an anti derivative for each of the following functions using the
method of inspection:
1
(i) cos 2x (ii) 3x2 + 4x3 (iii) , x ≠ 0
x
Solution
(i) We look for a function whose derivative is cos 2x. Recall that
d
sin 2x =2 cos 2x
dx
1 d d 1 
or cos 2x = (sin 2x) =  sin2x
2 dx dx 2 
1
Therefore, an anti derivative of cos 2x is sin2x.
2
(ii) We look for a function whose derivative is 3x2 + 4x3. Note that
d ( x3 +x4)
=3x2 + 4x3.
dx
Therefore, an anti derivative of 3x2 + 4x3 is x3 + x4.

(iii) We know that
d 1 d 1 1
(log x)= ,x>0and [log(– x)]= (–1)= ,x<0
dx x dx – x x
d 1
Combining above, we get ( log x) = ,x≠0

Therefore, ∫ dx=log x is one of the anti derivatives of .

= –cosx+sin x+C
(ii) We have
∫(cosecx(cosecx+cot x)dx=∫cosec2xdx+ ∫cosecxcot xdx

1–sin x 1 sin x
∫ dx=∫ dx – ∫ dx

Example 4 Find the anti derivative F of f defined by f (x) = 4x3 – 6, where F (0) = 3
Solution One anti derivative of f (x) is x4 – 6x since
d
(x4 –6x) = 4x3 – 6
dx
Therefore, the anti derivative F is given by
F(x) =x4 – 6x + C, where C is constant.
Rationalised 2023-24234 MATHEMATICS
Given that F(0) =3, which gives,
3 = 0 – 6 × 0 + C or C = 3
Hence, the required anti derivative is the unique function F defined by
F(x) =x4 – 6x + 3.
Remarks
(i) We see that if F is an anti derivative of f, then so is F + C, where C is any
constant. Thus, if we know one anti derivative F of a function f, we can write
down an infinite number of anti derivatives of f by adding any constant to F
expressed by F(x) + C, C ∈ R. In applications, it is often necessary to satisfy an
additional condition which then determines a specific value of C giving unique
anti derivative of the given function.
(ii) Sometimes, F is not expressible in terms of elementary functions viz., polynomial,
logarithmic, exponential, trigonometric functions and their inverses etc. We are
therefore blocked for finding ∫ f(x)dx. For example, it is not possible to find
∫e–x2 dx by inspection since we can not find a function whose derivative is e–x2
(iii) When the variable of integration is denoted by a variable other than x, the integral
formulae are modified accordingly. For instance
y4+1 1
∫y4 dy= +C= y5 +C

7.3 Methods of Integration
In previous section, we discussed integrals of those functions which were readily
obtainable from derivatives of some functions. It was based on inspection, i.e., on the
search of a function F whose derivative is f which led us to the integral of f. However,
this method, which depends on inspection, is not very suitable for many functions.
Hence, we need to develop additional techniques or methods for finding the integrals
by reducing them into standard forms. Prominent among them are methods based on:
1. Integration by Substitution
2. Integration using Partial Fractions
3. Integration by Parts
7.3.1 Integration by substitution
In this section, we consider the method of integration by substitution.
The given integral ∫ f(x)dx can be transformed into another form by changing
the independent variable x to t by substituting x = g (t).
Rationalised 2023-24236 MATHEMATICS
Consider I = ∫ f(x)dx
dx
Put x = g(t) so that = g′(t).
dt
We write dx = g′(t) dt
Thus I = ∫ f(x)dx=∫ f(g(t)) g′(t)dt
This change of variable formula is one of the important tools available to us in the
name of integration by substitution. It is often important to guess what will be the useful
substitution. Usually, we make a substitution for a function whose derivative also occurs
in the integrand as illustrated in the following examples.
Example 5 Integrate the following functions w.r.t. x:
(i) sin mx (ii) 2x sin (x2 + 1)
tan4 x sec2 x sin(tan–1 x)
(iii) (iv)
x 1+ x2
Solution
(i) We know that derivative of mx is m. Thus, we make the substitution
mx = t so that mdx = dt.
1 1 1
Therefore, ∫sinmxdx= ∫sint dt = – cos t + C = – cos mx + C
m m m
(ii) Derivative of x2 + 1 is 2x. Thus, we use the substitution x2 + 1 = t so that
2x dx = dt.
Therefore, ∫2xsin(x2 +1)dx=∫sintdt = – cos t + C = – cos (x2 + 1) + C
1 –1 1
(iii) Derivative of x is x 2 = . Thus, we use the substitution
2 2 x
1
x =tsothat dx=dtgiving dx = 2t dt.
2 x
tan4 x sec2 x 2ttan4tsec2t dt
Thus, ∫ dx=∫ = 2∫tan4t sec2t dt
x t
Again, we make another substitution tan t = u so that sec2 t dt = du
Rationalised 2023-24INTEGRALS 237
u5
Therefore, 2∫tan4tsec2t dt=2∫u4 du = 2 +C
5
2
= tan5 t +C (since u = tan t)
5
2
= tan5 x +C(sincet= x)
5
tan4 x sec2 x 2
Hence, ∫ dx = tan5 x +C
x 5
Alternatively, make the substitution tan x =t
1
(iv) Derivative of tan–1x= . Thus, we use the substitution
1+ x2
dx
tan–1 x = t so that = dt.
1+ x2
sin(tan–1x)
Therefore , ∫ dx=∫sint dt = – cos t + C = – cos(tan –1x) + C
1+ x2
Now, we discuss some important integrals involving trigonometric functions and
their standard integrals using substitution technique. These will be used later without
reference.
(i) ∫tan xdx=log sec x +C
We have
sin x
∫tan xdx=∫ dx
cos x
Put cos x = t so that sin x dx = – dt
dt
Then ∫tan xdx=–∫ =–log t +C=–log cosx +C

or ∫tan xdx=log secx +C
(ii) ∫cot xdx=log sinx +C
cosx
∫cot xdx=∫ dx
We have
sin x
Rationalised 2023-24238 MATHEMATICS
Put sin x = t so that cos x dx = dt
dt
Then ∫cot xdx=∫ = log t +C = log sin x +C
t
(iii) ∫sec xdx=log sec x+tan x +C
We have
secx(secx+tan x)
∫sec xdx=∫ dx
secx+tan x
Put sec x + tan x = t so that sec x (tan x + sec x) dx = dt
dt
Therefore, ∫secxdx=∫ =log t +C=log secx+tan x +C
t
(iv) ∫cosec xdx=log cosec x –cot x +C
We have
cosec x(cosecx +cotx)
∫cosecx dx=∫ dx
(cosecx +cotx)
Put cosec x + cot x = t so that – cosec x (cosec x + cot x) dx = dt
dt
So
∫cosecx dx=–∫ =–log|t|=–log|cosecx +cotx|+C

obtain the integral using the standard formulae.

To determine A and B, we equate from both sides the coefficients of x and the
constant terms. A and B are thus obtained and hence the integral is reduced to
one of the known forms.

7.5 Integration by Partial Fractions
Recall that a rational function is defined as the ratio of two polynomials in the form
P(x)
, where P (x) and Q(x) are polynomials in x and Q(x) ≠ 0. If the degree of P(x)
Q(x)
is less than the degree of Q(x), then the rational function is called proper, otherwise, it
is called improper. The improper rational functions can be reduced to the proper rational
Rationalised 2023-24INTEGRALS 253
P(x) P(x) P(x)
functions by long division process. Thus, if is improper, then =T(x)+ 1 ,
Q(x) Q(x) Q(x)
P(x)
where T(x) is a polynomial in x and 1 is a proper rational function. As we know
Q(x)
how to integrate polynomials, the integration of any rational function is reduced to the
integration of a proper rational function. The rational functions which we shall consider
here for integration purposes will be those whose denominators can be factorised into
P(x) P(x)
linear and quadratic factors. Assume that we want to evaluate ∫ dx, where
Q(x) Q(x)
is proper rational function. It is always possible to write the integrand as a sum of
simpler rational functions by a method called partial fraction decomposition. After this,
the integration can be carried out easily using the already known methods. The following
Table 7.2 indicates the types of simpler partial fractions that are to be associated with
various kind of rational functions.

Example 11 Find
(x+1)(x+2)
Solution The integrand is a proper rational function. Therefore, by using the form of
partial fraction [Table 7.2 (i)], we write
1 A B
= + ... (1)
(x+1)(x+2) x+1 x+2
where, real numbers A and B are to be determined suitably. This gives
1 = A (x + 2) + B (x + 1).
Equating the coefficients of x and the constant term, we get
A + B =0
and 2A + B =1
Solving these equations, we get A =1 and B = – 1.
Thus, the integrand is given by

Remark The equation (1) above is an identity, i.e. a statement true for all (permissible)
values of x. Some authors use the symbol ‘≡’ to indicate that the statement is an
identity and use the symbol ‘=’ to indicate that the statement is an equation, i.e., to
indicate that the statement is true only for certain values of x.

involves a combination of the substitution method and the partial fraction method.

7.6 Integration by Parts
In this section, we describe one more method of integration, that is found quite useful in
integrating products of functions.
If u and v are any two differentiable functions of a single variable x (say). Then, by
the product rule of differentiation, we have
d dv du
(uv) = u +v
dx dx dx
Integrating both sides, we get
dv du
uv = ∫u dx+∫v dx
dx dx
dv du
or ∫u dx = uv–∫v dx ... (1)
dx dx
dv
Let u =f(x) and = g(x). Then
dx
du
=f′(x) and v =
∫g(x)dx
dx
Rationalised 2023-24260 MATHEMATICS
Therefore, expression (1) can be rewritten as
∫ f(x) g(x)dx = f(x)∫g(x)dx–∫[∫g(x)dx] f′(x)dx
i.e., ∫ f(x) g (x)dx = f(x)∫g(x)dx–∫[ f′(x)∫g(x)dx]dx
If we take f as the first function and g as the second function, then this formula
may be stated as follows:
“The integral of the product of two functions = (first function) × (integral
of the second function) – Integral of [(differential coefficient of the first function)
× (integral of the second function)]”
Example 17 Find
∫xcosxdx
Solution Put f (x) = x (first function) and g (x) = cos x (second function).
Then, integration by parts gives
d
∫xcosxdx = x∫cos xdx– ∫[ (x)∫cosxdx]dx
dx
= xsin x–∫sin xdx = x sin x + cos x + C
Suppose, we take f(x) =cos x and g(x) = x. Then
d
∫xcosxdx
=
cosx∫xdx–∫[ (cosx)∫xdx]dx
dx
x2 x2
= (cosx) +∫sin x dx
2 2
Thus, it shows that the integral ∫xcosxdx is reduced to the comparatively more
complicated integral having more power of x. Therefore, the proper choice of the first
function and the second function is significant.
Remarks
(i) It is worth mentioning that integration by parts is not applicable to product of
functions in all cases. For instance, the method does not work for ∫ x sin xdx.
The reason is that there does not exist any function whose derivative is
x sin x.
(ii) Observe that while finding the integral of the second function, we did not add
any constant of integration. If we write the integral of the second function cos x
Rationalised 2023-24INTEGRALS 261
as sin x + k, where k is any constant, then
∫xcosxdx = x(sin x+k)−∫(sin x+k)dx
= x(sin x+k)−∫(sin xdx−∫k dx
= x(sin x+k)−cosx–kx+C = xsin x+cosx+C
This shows that adding a constant to the integral of the second function is
superfluous so far as the final result is concerned while applying the method of
integration by parts.
(iii) Usually, if any function is a power of x or a polynomial in x, then we take it as the
first function. However, in cases where other function is inverse trigonometric
function or logarithmic function, then we take them as first function.
Example 18 Find ∫log xdx
Solution To start with, we are unable to guess a function whose derivative is log x. We
take log x as the first function and the constant function 1 as the second function. Then,
the integral of the second function is x.

1−x2 1−x2
= – 1−x2 sin−1x+x+C = x– 1−x2 sin−1x+C
Alternatively, this integral can also be worked out by making substitution sin–1 x = θ and
then integrating by parts.
Example 21 Find ∫ex sin xdx
Solution Take ex as the first function and sin x as second function. Then, integrating
by parts, we have
I=∫ex sin xdx=ex(–cosx)+∫excosxdx
=– ex cos x + I (say) ... (1)
1
Taking exand cos x as the first and second functions, respectively, in I , we get
1
I = ex sin x–∫exsin xdx
1
Substituting the value of I in (1), we get
1
I = – ex cos x + ex sin x – I or 2I = ex (sin x – cos x)
ex
Hence, I = ∫ex sin xdx= (sin x–cosx)+C
2
Alternatively, above integral can also be determined by taking sin x as the first function
and ex the second function.
7.6.1 Integral of the type ∫ex[ f(x)+ f′(x)]dx
We have I = ∫ex [ f(x)+ f′(x)]dx = ∫exf(x)dx+∫exf′(x)dx

7.7 Definite Integral
In the previous sections, we have studied about the indefinite integrals and discussed
few methods of finding them including integrals of some special functions. In this
section, we shall study what is called definite integral of a function. The definite integral
b
has a unique value. A definite integral is denoted by ∫ f(x)dx, where a is called the
a
lower limit of the integral and b is called the upper limit of the integral. The definite
integral is introduced either as the limit of a sum or if it has an anti derivative F in the
interval [a, b], then its value is the difference between the values of F at the end
points, i.e., F(b) – F(a).
7.8 Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
7.8.1 Area function
b
We have defined ∫ f(x)dx as the area of
a
the region bounded by the curve y = f(x),
the ordinates x = a and x = b and x-axis. Let x
x
be a given point in [a, b]. Then ∫ f(x)dx
a
represents the area of the light shaded region
in Fig 7.1 [Here it is assumed that f(x) > 0 for
x ∈ [a, b], the assertion made below is
equally true for other functions as well].
The area of this shaded region depends upon Fig 7.1
the value of x.
In other words, the area of this shaded region is a function of x. We denote this
function of x by A(x). We call the function A(x) as Area function and is given by
x
A(x) = ∫ f(x)dx ... (1)
a
Based on this definition, the two basic fundamental theorems have been given.
However, we only state them as their proofs are beyond the scope of this text book.
7.8.2 First fundamental theorem of integral calculus
Theorem 1 Let f be a continuous function on the closed interval [a, b] and let A (x) be
the area function. Then A′′′′′(x) = f (x), for all x ∈∈∈∈∈ [a, b].
Rationalised 2023-24268 MATHEMATICS
7.8.3 Second fundamental theorem of integral calculus
We state below an important theorem which enables us to evaluate definite integrals
by making use of anti derivative.
Theorem 2 Let f be continuous function defined on the closed interval [a, b] and F be
b
an anti derivative of f. Then ∫ f(x)dx= [F(x)]b= F (b) – F(a).
a
a
Remarks
b
(i) In words, the Theorem 2 tells us that ∫ f(x)dx= (value of the anti derivative F
a
of f at the upper limit b – value of the same anti derivative at the lower limit a).
(ii) This theorem is very useful, because it gives us a method of calculating the
definite integral more easily, without calculating the limit of a sum.
(iii) The crucial operation in evaluating a definite integral is that of finding a function
whose derivative is equal to the integrand. This strengthens the relationship
between differentiation and integration.
b
(iv) In ∫ f(x)dx, the function f needs to be well defined and continuous in [a, b].
a
1
For instance, the consideration of definite integral ∫ 3 x(x2 –1)2 dx is erroneous
−2
1
since the function f expressed by f(x) = x(x2 –1)2 is not defined in a portion
– 1 < x < 1 of the closed interval [– 2, 3].
b
Steps for calculating ∫ f(x)dx.
a
(i) Find the indefinite integral∫ f(x)dx. Let this be F(x). There is no need to keep
integration constant C because if we consider F(x) + C instead of F(x), we get
b
∫ f(x)dx=[F(x)+C]b =[F(b)+C]–[F(a)+C]=F(b)–F(a).
a
a
Thus, the arbitrary constant disappears in evaluating the value of the definite
integral.
(ii) Evaluate F(b) – F(a) = [F(x)]b, which is the value of ∫ b f(x)dx.

7.9 Evaluation of Definite Integrals by Substitution
In the previous sections, we have discussed several methods for finding the indefinite
integral. One of the important methods for finding the indefinite integral is the method
of substitution.
b
To evaluate ∫ f(x)dx, by substitution, the steps could be as follows:
a
1. Consider the integral without limits and substitute, y = f(x) or x = g(y) to reduce
the given integral to a known form.
2. Integrate the new integrand with respect to the new variable without mentioning
the constant of integration.
3. Resubstitute for the new variable and write the answer in terms of the original
variable.
4. Find the values of answers obtained in (3) at the given limits of integral and find

Note In order to quicken this method, we can proceed as follows: After
performing steps 1, and 2, there is no need of step 3. Here, the integral will be kept
in the new variable itself, and the limits of the integral will accordingly be changed,
so that we can perform the last step.
Let us illustrate this by examples.
Example 26 Evaluate
∫1
5x4 x5+1dx.
−1
Solution Put t = x5 + 1, then dt = 5x4 dx.
3 3
2 2
Therefore, ∫5x4 x5 +1dx = ∫ tdt = t2 = ( x5 +1)2

3   3 3
Alternatively, first we transform the integral and then evaluate the transformed integral
with new limits.
Let t = x5 + 1. Then dt = 5 x4 dx.
Note that, when x =– 1, t = 0 and when x = 1, t = 2
Thus, as x varies from – 1 to 1, t varies from 0 to 2
Therefore ∫1 5x4 x5+1dx = ∫ 2 t dt

(ii) ∫ f(x)dx=0, if f is an odd function, i.e., if f(– x) = – f(x).

We give the proofs of these properties one by one.
Proof of P It follows directly by making the substitution x = t.
0
Proof of P Let F be anti derivative of f. Then, by the second fundamental theorem of
1

calculus, we have ∫ f(x)dx=F(b)–F(a)=–[F(a)−F(b)]=−∫ f(x)dx
a b

Here, we observe that, if a = b, then ∫ f(x)dx=0.

Adding (2) and (3), we get ∫ f(x)dx+∫ f(x)dx=F(b)–F(a)=∫ f(x)dx
a c a
This proves the property P .
2
Proof of P Let t = a + b – x. Then dt = – dx. When x = a, t = b and when x = b, t = a.
3
Therefore
b a
∫ f(x)dx = −∫ f(a+b–t)dt

b

a 0
Proof of P Put t = a – x. Then dt = – dx. When x = 0, t = a and when x = a, t = 0. Now

proceed as in P .

2a a 2a
Proof of P Using P , we have ∫ f(x)dx=∫ f(x)dx+∫ f(x)dx.
5 2 0 0 a
Let t =2a – x in the second integral on the right hand side. Then
dt =– dx. When x = a, t = a and when x = 2a, t = 0. Also x = 2a – t.
Therefore, the second integral becomes
∫ 2a f(x)dx = –∫ 0 f(2a–t)dt = ∫ a f(2a–t)dt = ∫ a f(2a–x)dx
a a 0 0
Hence ∫

Now, if f(2a – x) =f(x), then (1) becomes
∫ 2a f(x)dx = ∫ a f(x)dx+∫ a f(x)dx=2∫ a f(x)dx,
0 0 0 0
and if f(2a – x) = – f(x), then (1) becomes
∫ 2a f(x)dx = ∫ a f(x)dx−∫ a f(x)dx=0
0 0 0
Proof of P Using P , we have
7 2
∫ a f(x)dx = ∫ 0 f(x)dx+∫ a f(x)dx. Then
−a −a 0
Let t = – x in the first integral on the right hand side.
dt = – dx. When x = – a, t = a and when
x =0, t = 0. Also x = – t.
Therefore ∫ a f(x)dx = –∫ 0 f(–t)dt+∫ a f(x)dx

Summary
®
Integration is the inverse process of differentiation. In the differential calculus,
we are given a function and we have to find the derivative or differential of
this function, but in the integral calculus, we are to find a function whose
differential is given. Thus, integration is a process which is the inverse of
differentiation.
d
Let F(x)= f(x). Then we write ∫ f(x)dx=F(x)+C. These integrals
dx
are called indefinite integrals or general integrals, C is called constant of
integration. All these integrals differ by a constant.
®
Some properties of indefinite integrals are as follows:
1. ∫[f(x)+g (x)]dx= ∫ f(x)dx+∫g(x)dx
2. For any real number k, ∫k f(x)dx=k∫ f(x)dx
More generally, if f , f , f , ... , f are functions and k , k , ... ,k are real

Integration by partial fractions
P(x)
Recall that a rational function is ratio of two polynomials of the form ,
Q(x)
where P(x) and Q(x) are polynomials in x and Q(x) ≠ 0. If degree of the
polynomial P(x) is greater than the degree of the polynomial Q(x), then we
P(x) P(x)
may divide P(x) by Q(x) so that =T(x)+ 1 , where T(x) is a
Q(x) Q(x)
polynomial in x and degree of P (x) is less than the degree of Q(x). T(x)

Integration by substitution
A change in the variable of integration often reduces an integral to one of the
fundamental integrals. The method in which we change the variable to some
other variable is called the method of substitution. When the integrand involves
some trigonometric functions, we use some well known identities to find the
integrals. Using substitution technique, we obtain the following standard
integrals.
(i) ∫tanxdx=log secx +C (ii) ∫cotxdx=log sinx +C
(iii) ∫secxdx=log secx+tanx +C

Integration by parts
For given functions f and f , we have

, i.e., the
integral of the product of two functions = first function × integral of the
second function – integral of {differential coefficient of the first function ×
integral of the second function}. Care must be taken in choosing the first
function and the second function. Obviously, we must take that function as
the second function whose integral is well known to us.

This concept of area function leads to the Fundamental Theorems of Integral
Calculus.

Let the area function be defined by A(x) = ∫ f(x)dx for all x ≥ a, where

the function f is assumed to be continuous on [a, b]. Then A′(x) = f(x) for all

Second fundamental theorem of integral calculus
Let f be a continuous function of x defined on the closed interval [a, b] and
d
let F be another function such that F(x)= f(x) for all x in the domain of
dx
f, then ∫ b f(x)dx=[F(x)+C]b =F(b)−F(a).

This is called the definite integral of f over the range [a, b], where a and b
are called the limits of integration, a being the lower limit and b the
upper limit.
