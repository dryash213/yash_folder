13.1 Introduction
In earlier Classes, we have studied the probability as a
measure of uncertainty of events in a random experiment.
We discussed the axiomatic approach formulated by
Russian Mathematician, A.N. Kolmogorov (1903-1987)
and treated probability as a function of outcomes of the
experiment. We have also established equivalence between
the axiomatic theory and the classical theory of probability
in case of equally likely outcomes. On the basis of this
relationship, we obtained probabilities of events associated
with discrete sample spaces. We have also studied the
addition rule of probability. In this chapter, we shall discuss
the important concept of conditional probability of an event
given that another event has occurred, which will be helpful
in understanding the Bayes' theorem, multiplication rule of
Pierre de Fermat
probability and independence of events. We shall also learn (1601-1665)
an important concept of random variable and its probability
distribution and also the mean and variance of a probability distribution. In the last
section of the chapter, we shall study an important discrete probability distribution
called Binomial distribution. Throughout this chapter, we shall take up the experiments
having equally likely outcomes, unless stated otherwise.
13.2 Conditional Probability
Uptill now in probability, we have discussed the methods of finding the probability of
events. If we have two events from the same sample space, does the information
about the occurrence of one of the events affect the probability of the other event? Let
us try to answer this question by taking up a random experiment in which the outcomes
are equally likely to occur.
Consider the experiment of tossing three fair coins. The sample space of the
experiment is
S = {HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, HTT, THT, TTH, TTT}
Rationalised 2023-24PROBABILITY 407

Since the coins are fair, we can assign the probability to each sample point. Let
8
E be the event ‘at least two heads appear’ and F be the event ‘first coin shows tail’.
Then
E ={HHH, HHT, HTH, THH}
and F = {THH, THT, TTH, TTT}
Therefore P(E) =P ({HHH}) + P ({HHT}) + P ({HTH}) + P ({THH})
1 1 1 1 1
= + + + = (Why ?)
8 8 8 8 2
and P(F) =P ({THH}) + P ({THT}) + P ({TTH}) + P ({TTT})
1 1 1 1 1
= + + + =
8 8 8 8 2
Also E ∩ F ={THH}
1
with P(E ∩ F) =P({THH}) =
8
Now, suppose we are given that the first coin shows tail, i.e. F occurs, then what is
the probability of occurrence of E? With the information of occurrence of F, we are
sure that the cases in which first coin does not result into a tail should not be considered
while finding the probability of E. This information reduces our sample space from the
set S to its subset F for the event E. In other words, the additional information really
amounts to telling us that the situation may be considered as being that of a new
random experiment for which the sample space consists of all those outcomes only
which are favourable to the occurrence of the event F.
Now, the sample point of F which is favourable to event E is THH.
1
Thus, Probability of E considering F as the sample space = ,
4
1
or Probability of E given that the event F has occurred =
4
This probability of the event E is called the conditional probability of E given
that F has already occurred, and is denoted by P (E|F).
1
Thus P(E|F) =
4
Note that the elements of F which favour the event E are the common elements of
E and F, i.e. the sample points of E ∩ F.
Rationalised 2023-24408 MATHEMATICS
Thus, we can also write the conditional probability of E given that F has occurred as
Numberofelementaryeventsfavourableto E∩F
P(E|F) =
Numberofelementaryeventswhicharefavourableto F
n(E∩F)
=
n(F)
Dividing the numerator and the denominator by total number of elementary events
of the sample space, we see that P(E|F) can also be written as
n(E∩F)
n(S) P(E∩F)
P(E|F) = = ... (1)
n(F) P(F)
n(S)
Note that (1) is valid only when P(F) ≠ 0 i.e., F ≠ φ (Why?)
Thus, we can define the conditional probability as follows :
Definition 1 If E and F are two events associated with the same sample space of a
random experiment, the conditional probability of the event E given that F has occurred,
i.e. P (E|F) is given by
P(E∩F)
P(E|F) = provided P(F) ≠ 0
P(F)
13.2.1 Properties of conditional probability
Let E and F be events of a sample space S of an experiment, then we have
Property 1 P(S|F) = P(F|F) = 1
We know that
P(S∩F) P(F)
P(S|F) = = =1
P(F) P(F)
P(F∩F) P(F)
Also P(F|F) = = =1
P(F) P(F)
Thus P(S|F) = P(F|F) = 1
Property 2 If A and B are any two events of a sample space S and F is an event
of S such that P(F) ≠ 0, then
P((A ∪ B)|F) = P(A|F) + P(B|F) – P((A ∩ B)|F)
Rationalised 2023-24PROBABILITY 409
In particular, if A and B are disjoint events, then
P((A∪B)|F) =P(A|F) + P(B|F)
We have
P[(A∪B)∩F]
P((A∪B)|F) =
P(F)
P[(A∩F) ∪ (B∩F)]
=
P(F)
(by distributive law of union of sets over intersection)
P(A∩F)+P(B∩F)–P(A∩B ∩ F)
=
P(F)
P(A∩F) P(B∩F) P[(A∩B) ∩F]
= + −
P(F) P(F) P(F)
=P(A|F) + P(B|F) – P((A∩B)|F)
When A and B are disjoint events, then
P((A ∩ B)|F) =0
⇒ P((A ∪ B)|F) =P(A|F) + P(B|F)
Property 3 P(E′|F) = 1 − P(E|F)
From Property 1, we know that P(S|F) = 1
⇒ P(E ∪ E′|F) =1 since S = E ∪ E′
⇒ P(E|F) + P (E′|F) =1 since E and E′ are disjoint events
Thus, P(E′|F) =1 − P(E|F)
Let us now take up some examples.

Example 2 A family has two children. What is the probability that both the children are
boys given that at least one of them is a boy ?
Rationalised 2023-24410 MATHEMATICS
Solution Let b stand for boy and g for girl. The sample space of the experiment is
S = {(b, b), (g, b), (b, g), (g, g)}
Let E and F denote the following events :
E : ‘both the children are boys’
F : ‘at least one of the child is a boy’
Then E = {(b,b)} and F = {(b,b), (g,b), (b,g)}
Now E ∩ F = {(b,b)}

Thus P(F) = and P (E ∩ F )=

Example 3 Ten cards numbered 1 to 10 are placed in a box, mixed up thoroughly and
then one card is drawn randomly. If it is known that the number on the drawn card is
more than 3, what is the probability that it is an even number?
Solution Let A be the event ‘the number on the card drawn is even’ and B be the
event ‘the number on the card drawn is greater than 3’. We have to find P(A|B).
Now, the sample space of the experiment is S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
Then A = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}, B = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
and A ∩ B = {4, 6, 8, 10}

Example 4 In a school, there are 1000 students, out of which 430 are girls. It is known
that out of 430, 10% of the girls study in class XII. What is the probability that a student
chosen randomly studies in Class XII given that the chosen student is a girl?
Solution Let E denote the event that a student chosen randomly studies in Class XII
and F be the event that the randomly chosen student is a girl. We have to find P (E|F).

Now P(F) = =0.43 and P(E ∩ F)= =0.043 (Why?)

Then P(E|F) = = =0.1

Example 5 A die is thrown three times. Events A and B are defined as below:
A : 4 on the third throw
B : 6 on the first and 5 on the second throw
Find the probability of A given that B has already occurred.
Solution The sample space has 216 outcomes.

Example 6 A die is thrown twice and the sum of the numbers appearing is observed
to be 6. What is the conditional probability that the number 4 has appeared at least
once?
Solution Let E be the event that ‘number 4 appears at least once’ and F be the event
that ‘the sum of the numbers appearing is 6’.
Then, E ={(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (5,4), (6,4)}
and F = {(1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1)}

We have P(E) = and P(F) =

Also E∩F ={(2,4), (4,2)}

For the conditional probability discussed above, we have considered the elemen-
tary events of the experiment to be equally likely and the corresponding definition of
the probability of an event was used. However, the same definition can also be used in
the general case where the elementary events of the sample space are not equally
likely, the probabilities P(E∩F) and P(F) being calculated accordingly. Let us take up
the following example.
Example 7 Consider the experiment of tossing a coin. If the coin shows head, toss it
again but if it shows tail, then throw a die. Find the
conditional probability of the event that ‘the die shows
a number greater than 4’ given that ‘there is at least
one tail’.
Solution The outcomes of the experiment can be
represented in following diagrammatic manner called
the ‘tree diagram’.
The sample space of the experiment may be
Fig 13.1
described as
S = {(H,H), (H,T), (T,1), (T,2), (T,3), (T,4), (T,5), (T,6)}
where (H, H) denotes that both the tosses result into
head and (T, i) denote the first toss result into a tail and
the number i appeared on the die for i = 1,2,3,4,5,6.
Thus, the probabilities assigned to the 8 elementary
events

Let F be the event that ‘there is at least one tail’ and E be the event ‘the die shows
a number greater than 4’. Then
F = {(H,T), (T,1), (T,2), (T,3), (T,4), (T,5), (T,6)}
E ={(T,5), (T,6)} and E ∩ F = {(T,5), (T,6)}
Now P(F) =P({(H,T)}) + P ({(T,1)}) + P ({(T,2)}) + P ({(T,3)})

13.3 Multiplication Theorem on Probability
Let E and F be two events associated with a sample space S. Clearly, the set E ∩ F
denotes the event that both E and F have occurred. In other words, E ∩ F denotes the
simultaneous occurrence of the events E and F. The event E ∩ F is also written as EF.
Very often we need to find the probability of the event EF. For example, in the
experiment of drawing two cards one after the other, we may be interested in finding
the probability of the event ‘a king and a queen’. The probability of event EF is obtained
by using the conditional probability as obtained below :
We know that the conditional probability of event E given that F has occurred is
denoted by P(E|F) and is given by
P(E ∩F)
P(E|F) = ,P(F)≠0
P(F)
From this result, we can write
P(E ∩ F) =P(F) . P(E|F) ... (1)
Also, we know that
P(F∩E)
P(F|E) = ,P(E)≠0
P(E)
P(E ∩F)
or P(F|E) = (since E ∩ F = F ∩ E)
P(E)
Thus, P(E ∩ F) =P(E). P(F|E) .... (2)
Combining (1) and (2), we find that
P(E ∩ F) =P(E) P(F|E)
=P(F) P(E|F) provided P(E) ≠ 0 and P(F) ≠ 0.
The above result is known as the multiplication rule of probability.
Let us now take up an example.
Example 8 An urn contains 10 black and 5 white balls. Two balls are drawn from the
urn one after the other without replacement. What is the probability that both drawn
balls are black?
Solution Let E and F denote respectively the events that first and second ball drawn
are black. We have to find P(E ∩ F) or P(EF).
Rationalised 2023-24416 MATHEMATICS
10
Now P(E) = P (black ball in first draw) =
15
Also given that the first ball drawn is black, i.e., event E has occurred, now there
are 9 black balls and five white balls left in the urn. Therefore, the probability that the
second ball drawn is black, given that the ball in the first draw is black, is nothing but
the conditional probability of F given that E has occurred.
9
i.e. P(F|E) =
14
By multiplication rule of probability, we have
P(E ∩ F) = P(E) P(F|E)
10 9 3
= × =
15 14 7
Multiplication rule of probability for more than two events If E, F and G are
three events of sample space, we have
P(E ∩ F ∩ G) = P(E) P(F|E) P(G|(E ∩ F)) = P(E) P(F|E) P(G|EF)
Similarly, the multiplication rule of probability can be extended for four or
more events.
The following example illustrates the extension of multiplication rule of probability
for three events.
Example 9 Three cards are drawn successively, without replacement from a pack of
52 well shuffled cards. What is the probability that first two cards are kings and the
third card drawn is an ace?
Solution Let K denote the event that the card drawn is king and A be the event that
the card drawn is an ace. Clearly, we have to find P (KKA)
4
Now P(K) =
52
Also, P(K|K) is the probability of second king with the condition that one king has
already been drawn. Now there are three kings in (52 − 1) = 51 cards.
3
Therefore P(K|K) =
51
Lastly, P(A|KK) is the probability of third drawn card to be an ace, with the condition
that two kings have already been drawn. Now there are four aces in left 50 cards.
Rationalised 2023-24PROBABILITY 417
4
Therefore P(A|KK) =
50
By multiplication law of probability, we have
P(KKA) =P(K) P(K|K) P(A|KK)

13.4 Independent Events
Consider the experiment of drawing a card from a deck of 52 playing cards, in which
the elementary events are assumed to be equally likely. If E and F denote the events
'the card drawn is a spade' and 'the card drawn is an ace' respectively, then
13 1 4 1
P(E) = = andP(F)= =
52 4 52 13
Also E and F is the event ' the card drawn is the ace of spades' so that
1
P(E∩F) =
52
1
P(E ∩F) 52 1
Hence P(E|F) = = =
P(F) 1 4
13
1
Since P(E) = = P (E|F), we can say that the occurrence of event F has not
4
affected the probability of occurrence of the event E.
We also have
1
P(E ∩F) 52 1
P(F|E) = = = =P(F)
P(E) 1 13
4
1
Again, P(F) = = P(F|E) shows that occurrence of event E has not affected
13
the probability of occurrence of the event F.
Thus, E and F are two events such that the probability of occurrence of one of
them is not affected by occurrence of the other.
Such events are called independent events.
Rationalised 2023-24418 MATHEMATICS
Definition 2 Two events E and F are said to be independent, if
P(F|E) = P (F) provided P (E) ≠ 0
and P(E|F) = P (E) provided P (F) ≠ 0
Thus, in this definition we need to have P (E) ≠ 0 and P(F) ≠ 0
Now, by the multiplication rule of probability, we have
P(E ∩ F) = P(E) . P (F|E) ... (1)
If E and F are independent, then (1) becomes
P(E ∩ F) = P(E) . P(F) ... (2)
Thus, using (2), the independence of two events is also defined as follows:
Definition 3 Let E and F be two events associated with the same random experiment,
then E and F are said to be independent if
P(E ∩ F) = P(E) . P (F)
Remarks
(i) Two events E and F are said to be dependent if they are not independent, i.e. if
P(E ∩ F ) ≠ P(E) . P (F)
(ii) Sometimes there is a confusion between independent events and mutually
exclusive events. Term ‘independent’ is defined in terms of ‘probability of events’
whereas mutually exclusive is defined in term of events (subset of sample space).
Moreover, mutually exclusive events never have an outcome common, but
independent events, may have common outcome. Clearly, ‘independent’ and
‘mutually exclusive’ do not have the same meaning.
In other words, two independent events having nonzero probabilities of occurrence
can not be mutually exclusive, and conversely, i.e. two mutually exclusive events
having nonzero probabilities of occurrence can not be independent.
(iii) Two experiments are said to be independent if for every pair of events E and F,
where E is associated with the first experiment and F with the second experiment,
the probability of the simultaneous occurrence of the events E and F when the
two experiments are performed is the product of P(E) and P(F) calculated
separately on the basis of two experiments, i.e., P (E ∩ F) = P (E) . P(F)
(iv) Three events A, B and C are said to be mutually independent, if
P(A ∩ B) = P(A) P(B)
P(A ∩ C) = P(A) P(C)
P(B ∩ C) = P(B) P(C)
and P(A ∩ B ∩ C) = P(A) P(B) P(C)
Rationalised 2023-24PROBABILITY 419
If at least one of the above is not true for three given events, we say that the
events are not independent.
Example 10 A die is thrown. If E is the event ‘the number appearing is a multiple of
3’ and F be the event ‘the number appearing is even’ then find whether E and F are
independent ?
Solution We know that the sample space is S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
Now E = { 3, 6}, F = { 2, 4, 6} and E ∩ F = {6}
2 1 3 1 1
Then P(E) = = , P(F)= = and P(E∩ F)=
6 3 6 2 6
Clearly P(E ∩ F) = P(E). P (F)
Hence E and F are independent events.
Example 11 An unbiased die is thrown twice. Let the event A be ‘odd number on the
first throw’ and B the event ‘odd number on the second throw’. Check the independence
of the events A and B.
Solution If all the 36 elementary events of the experiment are considered to be equally
likely, we have
18 1 18 1
P(A) = = and P(B)= =
36 2 36 2
Also P(A ∩ B) =P (odd number on both throws)
9 1
= =
36 4
1 1 1
Now P(A) P(B) = × =
2 2 4
Clearly P(A ∩ B) =P(A) × P(B)
Thus, A and B are independent events
Example 12 Three coins are tossed simultaneously. Consider the event E ‘three heads
or three tails’, F ‘at least two heads’ and G ‘at most two heads’. Of the pairs (E,F),
(E,G) and (F,G), which are independent? which are dependent?
Solution The sample space of the experiment is given by

13.5 Bayes' Theorem
Consider that there are two bags I and II. Bag I contains 2 white and 3 red balls and
Bag II contains 4 white and 5 red balls. One ball is drawn at random from one of the
1
bags. We can find the probability of selecting any of the bags (i.e. ) or probability of
2
drawing a ball of a particular colour (say white) from a particular bag (say Bag I). In
other words, we can find the probability that the ball drawn is of a particular colour, if
we are given the bag from which the ball is drawn. But, can we find the probability that
the ball drawn is from a particular bag (say Bag II), if the colour of the ball drawn is
given? Here, we have to find the reverse probability of Bag II to be selected when an
event occurred after it is known. Famous mathematician, John Bayes' solved the problem
of finding reverse probability by using conditional probability. The formula developed
by him is known as ‘Bayes theorem’ which was published posthumously in 1763.
Before stating and proving the Bayes' theorem, let us first take up a definition and
some preliminary results.
13.5.1 Partition of a sample space
A set of events E , E , ..., E is said to represent a partition of the sample space S if
1 2 n
(a) E ∩ E = φ, i ≠ j, i, j = 1, 2, 3, ..., n
i j
Rationalised 2023-24424 MATHEMATICS
(b) E ∪ Ε ∪ ... ∪ E = S and
1 2 n
(c) P(E)>0 for all i = 1, 2, ..., n.
i
In other words, the events E , E , ..., E represent a partition of the sample space
1 2 n
S if they are pairwise disjoint, exhaustive and have nonzero probabilities.
As an example, we see that any nonempty event E and its complement E′ form a
partition of the sample space S since they satisfy E ∩ E′ = φ and E ∪ E′ = S.
From the Venn diagram in Fig 13.3, one can easily observe that if E and F are any
two events associated with a sample space S, then the set {E ∩ F′, E ∩ F, E′ ∩ F, E′ ∩ F′}
is a partition of the sample space S. It may be mentioned that the partition of a sample
space is not unique. There can be several partitions of the same sample space.
We shall now prove a theorem known as Theorem of total probability.
13.5.2 Theorem of total probability
Let {E , E ,...,E } be a partition of the sample space S, and suppose that each of the
1 2 n
events E , E ,..., E has nonzero probability of occurrence. Let A be any event associated
1 2 n
with S, then
P(A) = P(E) P(A|E ) + P(E ) P(A|E ) + ... + P(E ) P(A|E )

Proof Given that E, E ,..., E is a partition of the sample space S (Fig 13.4). Therefore,
1 2 n
S = E ∪ E ∪ ... ∪ E ... (1)
1 2 n
and E ∩ E = φ, i ≠ j, i, j = 1, 2, ..., n
i j
Now, we know that for any event A,
A = A ∩ S
=A ∩ (E ∪ E ∪ ... ∪ E )
1 2 n
=(A ∩ E ) ∪ (A ∩ E ) ∪ ...∪ (A ∩ E ) Fig 13.4
1 2 n
Also A ∩ E and A ∩ E are respectively the subsets of E and E. We know that
i j i j
E and E are disjoint, for i≠ j, therefore, A ∩ E and A ∩ E are also disjoint for all
i j i j
i ≠ j, i, j = 1, 2, ..., n.
Thus, P(A) = P [(A ∩ E ) ∪ (A ∩ E )∪ .....∪ (A ∩ E )]
1 2 n
=P (A ∩ E ) + P (A ∩ E ) + ... + P (A ∩ E )

Now, by multiplication rule of probability, we have
P(A ∩ E) = P(E) P(A|E) as P (E) ≠ 0∀i = 1,2,..., n

Example 15 A person has undertaken a construction job. The probabilities are 0.65
that there will be strike, 0.80 that the construction job will be completed on time if there
is no strike, and 0.32 that the construction job will be completed on time if there is a
strike. Determine the probability that the construction job will be completed on time.
Solution Let A be the event that the construction job will be completed on time, and B
be the event that there will be a strike. We have to find P(A).
We have
P(B) =0.65, P(no strike) = P(B′) = 1 − P(B) = 1 − 0.65 = 0.35
P(A|B) =0.32, P(A|B′) = 0.80
Since events B and B′ form a partition of the sample space S, therefore, by theorem
on total probability, we have
P(A) =P(B) P(A|B) + P(B′) P(A|B′)
= 0.65 × 0.32 + 0.35 × 0.8
= 0.208 + 0.28 = 0.488
Thus, the probability that the construction job will be completed in time is 0.488.
We shall now state and prove the Bayes' theorem.
Bayes’ Theorem If E , E ,..., E are n non empty events which constitute a partition
1 2 n
of sample space S, i.e. E , E ,..., E are pairwise disjoint and E ∪ E ∪ ... ∪ E = S and

Remark The following terminology is generally used when Bayes' theorem is applied.
The events E , E , ..., E are called hypotheses.
1 2 n
The probability P(E) is called the priori probability of the hypothesis E
i i
The conditional probability P(E |A) is called a posteriori probability of the
i
hypothesis E.
i
Bayes' theorem is also called the formula for the probability of "causes". Since the
E's are a partition of the sample space S, one and only one of the events E occurs (i.e.
i i
one of the events E must occur and only one can occur). Hence, the above formula
i
gives us the probability of a particular E (i.e. a "Cause"), given that the event A has
i
occurred.
The Bayes' theorem has its applications in variety of situations, few of which are
illustrated in following examples.
Example 16 Bag I contains 3 red and 4 black balls while another Bag II contains 5 red
and 6 black balls. One ball is drawn at random from one of the bags and it is found to
be red. Find the probability that it was drawn from Bag II.
Solution Let E be the event of choosing the bag I, E the event of choosing the bag II

and A be the event of drawing a red ball.

Then P(E ) = P(E) =

Also P(A|E ) = P(drawing a red ball from Bag I) =

Example 18 Suppose that the reliability of a HIV test is specified as follows:
Of people having HIV, 90% of the test detect the disease but 10% go undetected. Of
people free of HIV, 99% of the test are judged HIV–ive but 1% are diagnosed as
showing HIV+ive. From a large population of which only 0.1% have HIV, one person
is selected at random, given the HIV test, and the pathologist reports him/her as
HIV+ive. What is the probability that the person actually has HIV?
Solution Let E denote the event that the person selected is actually having HIV and A
the event that the person's HIV test is diagnosed as +ive. We need to find P(E|A).
Also E′ denotes the event that the person selected is actually not having HIV.
Clearly, {E, E′} is a partition of the sample space of all people in the population.
We are given that

P(E) =0.1% = =0.001

Rationalised 2023-24428 MATHEMATICS

100
and P(A|E′) = P(Person tested as HIV +ive given that he/she

Now, by Bayes' theorem
P(E)P(A|E)
P(E|A) =

0.001×0.9 90
= =
0.001×0.9+0.999×0.01 1089

Thus, the probability that a person selected at random is actually having HIV
given that he/she is tested HIV+ive is 0.083.
Example 19 In a factory which manufactures bolts, machines A, B and C manufacture
respectively 25%, 35% and 40% of the bolts. Of their outputs, 5, 4 and 2 percent are
respectively defective bolts. A bolt is drawn at random from the product and is found
to be defective. What is the probability that it is manufactured by the machine B?
Solution Let events B , B , B be the following :
1 2 3
B : the bolt is manufactured by machine A
1
B : the bolt is manufactured by machine B
2
B : the bolt is manufactured by machine C

Clearly, B , B , B are mutually exclusive and exhaustive events and hence, they

represent a partition of the sample space.
Let the event E be ‘the bolt is defective’.
The event E occurs with B or with B or with B . Given that,
1 2 3
P(B ) = 25% = 0.25, P (B ) = 0.35 and P(B ) = 0.40

Remark A random variable is a real valued function whose domain is the sample
space of a random experiment.
For example, let us consider the experiment of tossing a coin two times in succession.
The sample space of the experiment is S = {HH, HT, TH, TT}.
Rationalised 2023-24PROBABILITY 431
If X denotes the number of heads obtained, then X is a random variable and for
each outcome, its value is as given below :
X(HH) =2, X (HT) = 1, X (TH) = 1, X (TT) = 0.
More than one random variables can be defined on the same sample space. For
example, let Y denote the number of heads minus the number of tails for each outcome
of the above sample space S.
Then Y(HH) =2, Y (HT) = 0, Y (TH) = 0, Y (TT) = – 2.
Thus, X and Y are two different random variables defined on the same sample
space S.

Historical Note
The earliest indication on measurement of chances in game of dice appeared
in 1477 in a commentary on Dante's Divine Comedy. A treatise on gambling
named liber de Ludo Alcae, by Geronimo Carden (1501-1576) was published
posthumously in 1663. In this treatise, he gives the number of favourable cases
for each event when two dice are thrown.
Galileo (1564-1642) gave casual remarks concerning the correct evaluation
of chance in a game of three dice. Galileo analysed that when three dice are
thrown, the sum of the number that appear is more likely to be 10 than the sum 9,
because the number of cases favourable to 10 are more than the number of
cases for the appearance of number 9.
Apart from these early contributions, it is generally acknowledged that the
true origin of the science of probability lies in the correspondence between two
great men of the seventeenth century, Pascal (1623-1662) and Pierre de Fermat
(1601-1665). A French gambler, Chevalier de Metre asked Pascal to explain
some seeming contradiction between his theoretical reasoning and the
observation gathered from gambling. In a series of letters written around 1654,
Pascal and Fermat laid the first foundation of science of probability. Pascal solved
the problem in algebraic manner while Fermat used the method of combinations.
Great Dutch Scientist, Huygens (1629-1695), became acquainted with the
content of the correspondence between Pascal and Fermat and published a first
book on probability, "De Ratiociniis in Ludo Aleae" containing solution of many
interesting rather than difficult problems on probability in games of chances.
The next great work on probability theory is by Jacob Bernoulli (1654-1705),
in the form of a great book, "Ars Conjectendi" published posthumously in 1713
by his nephew, Nicholes Bernoulli. To him is due the discovery of one of the most
important probability distribution known as Binomial distribution. The next
remarkable work on probability lies in 1993. A. N. Kolmogorov (1903-1987) is
credited with the axiomatic theory of probability. His book, ‘Foundations of
probability’ published in 1933, introduces probability as a set function and is
considered a ‘classic!’.
