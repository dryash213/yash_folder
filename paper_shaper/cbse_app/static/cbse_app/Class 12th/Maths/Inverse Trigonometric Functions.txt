10.1 Introduction
In our day to day life, we come across many queries such
as – What is your height? How should a football player hit
the ball to give a pass to another player of his team? Observe
that a possible answer to the first query may be 1.6 meters,
a quantity that involves only one value (magnitude) which
is a real number. Such quantities are called scalars.
However, an answer to the second query is a quantity (called
force) which involves muscular strength (magnitude) and
direction (in which another player is positioned). Such
quantities are called vectors. In mathematics, physics and
engineering, we frequently come across with both types of
W.R. Hamilton
quantities, namely, scalar quantities such as length, mass,
(1805-1865)
time, distance, speed, area, volume, temperature, work,
money, voltage, density, resistance etc. and vector quantities like displacement, velocity,
acceleration, force, weight, momentum, electric field intensity etc.
In this chapter, we will study some of the basic concepts about vectors, various
operations on vectors, and their algebraic and geometric properties. These two type of
properties, when considered together give a full realisation to the concept of vectors,
and lead to their vital applicability in various areas as mentioned above.
10.2 Some Basic Concepts
Let ‘l’ be any straight line in plane or three dimensional space. This line can be given
two directions by means of arrowheads. A line with one of these directions prescribed
is called a directed line (Fig 10.1 (i), (ii)).
Rationalised 2023-24VECTOR ALGEBRA 339
Fig 10.1
Now observe that if we restrict the line l to the line segment AB, then a magnitude
is prescribed on the line l with one of the two directions, so that we obtain a directed
line segment (Fig 10.1(iii)). Thus, a directed line segment has magnitude as well as
direction.
Definition 1 A quantity that has magnitude as well as direction is called a vector.
Notice that a directed line segment is a vector (Fig 10.1(iii)), denoted as or
simply as , and read as ‘vector ’ or ‘vector ’.
The point A from where the vector starts is called its initial point, and the
point B where it ends is called its terminal point. The distance between initial and
terminal points of a vector is called the magnitude (or length) of the vector, denoted as
| |, or | |, or a. The arrow indicates the direction of the vector.
A
Note Since the length is never negative, the notation | | < 0 has no meaning.
Position Vector
From Class XI, recall the three dimensional right handed rectangular coordinate system
(Fig 10.2(i)). Consider a point P in space, having coordinates (x, y, z) with respect to
the origin O(0, 0, 0). Then, the vector having O and P as its initial and terminal
points, respectively, is called the position vector of the point P with respect
to O. Using distance formula (from Class XI), the magnitude of (or ) is given by
| |= x2 + y2 +z2
In practice, the position vectors of points A, B, C, etc., with respect to the origin O
are denoted by , , , etc., respectively (Fig 10.2 (ii)).

Direction Cosines
Consider the position vector of a point P(x, y, z) as in Fig 10.3. The angles α,
β, γ made by the vector with the positive directions of x, y and z-axes respectively,
are called its direction angles. The cosine values of these angles, i.e., cosα, cosβ and
cosγ are called direction cosines of the vector , and usually denoted by l, m and n,
respectively.

From Fig 10.3, one may note that the triangle OAP is right angled, and in it, we
have . Similarly, from the right angled triangles OBP and
y z
OCP, we may write cosβ= and cosγ= . Thus, the coordinates of the point P may
r r
also be expressed as (lr, mr,nr). The numbers lr, mr and nr, proportional to the direction
cosines are called as direction ratios of vector , and denoted as a, b and c, respectively.

Note One may note that l2 + m2 + n2 = 1 but a2 + b2 + c2 ≠ 1, in general.
10.3 Types of Vectors
Zero Vector A vector whose initial and terminal points coincide, is called a zero vector
(or null vector), and denoted as . Zero vector can not be assigned a definite direction
as it has zero magnitude. Or, alternatively otherwise, it may be regarded as having any
direction. The vectors represent the zero vector,
Unit Vector A vector whose magnitude is unity (i.e., 1 unit) is called a unit vector. The
unit vector in the direction of a given vector is denoted by aˆ.
Coinitial Vectors Two or more vectors having the same initial point are called coinitial
vectors.
Collinear Vectors Two or more vectors are said to be collinear if they are parallel to
the same line, irrespective of their magnitudes and directions.
Equal Vectors Two vectors are said to be equal, if they have the same
magnitude and direction regardless of the positions of their initial points, and written
as .
Negative of a Vector A vector whose magnitude is the same as that of a given vector
(say, ), but direction is opposite to that of it, is called negative of the given vector.
For example, vector is negative of the vector , and written as = – .
Remark The vectors defined above are such that any of them may be subject to its
parallel displacement without changing its magnitude and direction. Such vectors are
called free vectors. Throughout this chapter, we will be dealing with free vectors only.
Example 1 Represent graphically a displacement
of 40 km, 30° west of south.
Solution The vector represents the required
displacement (Fig 10.4).

10.4 Addition of Vectors
A vector simply means the displacement from a point
A to the point B. Now consider a situation that a girl
moves from A to B and then from B to C
(Fig 10.7). The net displacement made by the girl from
point A to the point C, is given by the vector and
Fig 10.7
expressed as
=
This is known as the triangle law of vector addition.
In general, if we have two vectors and (Fig 10.8 (i)), then to add them, they are
positioned so that the initial point of one coincides with the terminal point of the other
(Fig 10.8(ii)).

For example, in Fig 10.8 (ii), we have shifted vector without changing its magnitude
and direction, so that it’s initial point coincides with the terminal point of . Then, the
vector + , represented by the third side AC of the triangle ABC, gives us the sum (or
resultant) of the vectors and i.e., in triangle ABC (Fig 10.8 (ii)), we have
=
Now again, since , from the above equation, we have
This means that when the sides of a triangle are taken in order, it leads to zero
resultant as the initial and terminal points get coincided (Fig 10.8(iii)).
Rationalised 2023-24344 MATHEMATICS
Now, construct a vector so that its magnitude is same as the vector , but the
direction opposite to that of it (Fig 10.8 (iii)), i.e.,
=
Then, on applying triangle law from the Fig 10.8 (iii), we have
=
The vector is said to represent the difference of .
Now, consider a boat in a river going from one bank of the river to the other in a
direction perpendicular to the flow of the river. Then, it is acted upon by two velocity
vectors–one is the velocity imparted to the boat by its engine and other one is the
velocity of the flow of river water. Under the simultaneous influence of these two
velocities, the boat in actual starts travelling with a different velocity. To have a precise
idea about the effective speed and direction
(i.e., the resultant velocity) of the boat, we have
the following law of vector addition.
If we have two vectors represented
by the two adjacent sides of a parallelogram
in magnitude and direction (Fig 10.9), then their
sum is represented in magnitude and
direction by the diagonal of the parallelogram
through their common point. This is known as
Fig 10.9
the parallelogram law of vector addition.
A
Note F rom Fig 10.9, using the triangle law, one may note that
=
or = (since )
which is parallelogram law. Thus, we may say that the two laws of vector
addition are equivalent to each other.
Properties of vector addition
Property 1 For any two vectors ,
= (Commutative property)
Rationalised 2023-24VECTOR ALGEBRA 345
Proof Consider the parallelogram ABCD
(Fig 10.10). Let then using
the triangle law, from triangle ABC, we have
Now, since the opposite sides of a
parallelogram are equal and parallel, from
Fig10.10, we have, and
Fig 10.10
. Again using triangle law, from
triangle ADC, we have
Hence =
Property 2 For any three vectors a,b andc
= (Associative property)
Proof Let the vectors be represented by , respectively, as
shown in Fig 10.11(i) and (ii).

and =
Hence =
Remark The associative property of vector addition enables us to write the sum of
three vectors without using brackets.
Note that for any vector a, we have
=
Here, the zero vector is called the additive identity for the vector addition.
10.5 Multiplication of a Vector by a Scalar
Let be a given vector and λ a scalar. Then the product of the vector by the scalar
λ, denoted as λ , is called the multiplication of vector by the scalar λ. Note that, λ
is also a vector, collinear to the vector . The vector λ has the direction same (or
opposite) to that of vector according as the value of λ is positive (or negative). Also,
the magnitude of vector λ is |λ| times the magnitude of the vector , i.e.,
|λ | =|λ|| |
A geometric visualisation of multiplication of a vector by a scalar is given
in Fig 10.12.

When λ = –1, then λ = – , which is a vector having magnitude equal to the
magnitude of and direction opposite to that of the direction of . The vector – is
called the negative (or additive inverse) of vector and we always have

Also, if λ= , provided ≠ 0 i.e. is not a null vector, then

Note For any scalar k, k0=0.
10.5.1 Components of a vector
Let us take the points A(1, 0, 0), B(0, 1, 0) and C(0, 0, 1) on the x-axis, y-axis and
z-axis, respectively. Then, clearly
| |= 1, | |=1 and | |= 1
The vectors , each having magnitude 1,
are called unit vectors along the axes OX, OY and OZ,
respectively, and denoted by iˆ, ˆj and kˆ, respectively
(Fig 10.13).
Fig 10.13
Now, consider the position vector of a point P(x, y, z)
as in Fig 10.14. Let P be the foot of the perpendicular from P on the plane XOY.
1
Fig 10.14
We, thus, see that P P is parallel to z-axis. As iˆ, ˆj and kˆ are the unit vectors along the
1
x, y and z-axes, respectively, and by the definition of the coordinates of P, we have
. Similarly, and .
Rationalised 2023-24348 MATHEMATICS
Therefore, it follows that =
and =
Hence, the position vector of P with reference to O is given by
=
This form of any vector is called its component form. Here, x, y and z are called
as the scalar components of , and xiˆ, yˆj and zkˆ are called the vector components
of along the respective axes. Sometimes x, y and z are also termed as rectangular
components.
The length of any vector r ==xiˆ + yˆj+zkˆ , is readily determined by applying the
Pythagoras theorem twice. We note that in the right angle triangle OQP (Fig 10.14)

and in the right angle triangle OP P, we have

collinear to the vector . In fact, two vectors are collinear if and only if
there exists a nonzero scalar λ such that . If the vectors are given
in the component form, i.e. a == aiˆ +a ˆj+a kˆ and , then the

the respective components x, y and z of the vector. So, for the given vector, we have
a = 1, b = 1 and c = –2. Further, if l, m and n are the direction cosines of the given

10.5.3 Section formula
Let P and Q be two points represented by the position vectors , respectively,
with respect to the origin O. Then the line segment
joining the points P and Q may be divided by a third
point, say R, in two ways – internally (Fig 10.16)
and externally (Fig 10.17). Here, we intend to find
the position vector for the point R with respect
to the origin O. We take the two cases one by one.
Case I When R divides PQ internally (Fig 10.16).
If R divides such that = , Fig 10.16

10.6 Product of Two Vectors
So far we have studied about addition and subtraction of vectors. An other algebraic
operation which we intend to discuss regarding vectors is their product. We may
recall that product of two numbers is a number, product of two matrices is again a
matrix. But in case of functions, we may multiply them in two ways, namely,
multiplication of two functions pointwise and composition of two functions. Similarly,
multiplication of two vectors is also defined in two ways, namely, scalar (or dot)
product where the result is a scalar, and vector (or cross) product where the
result is a vector. Based upon these two types of products for vectors, they have
found various applications in geometry, mechanics and engineering. In this section,
we will discuss these two types of products.

Historical Note
The word vector has been derived from a Latin word vectus, which means
“to carry”. The germinal ideas of modern vector theory date from around 1800
when Caspar Wessel (1745-1818) and Jean Robert Argand (1768-1822) described
that how a complex number a + ib could be given a geometric interpretation with
the help of a directed line segment in a coordinate plane. William Rowen Hamilton
(1805-1865) an Irish mathematician was the first to use the term vector for a
directed line segment in his book Lectures on Quaternions (1853). Hamilton’s
method of quaternions (an ordered set of four real numbers given as:
a+biˆ +cˆj+dkˆ ,iˆ, ˆj, kˆ following certain algebraic rules) was a solution to the
problem of multiplying vectors in three dimensional space. Though, we must
mention here that in practice, the idea of vector concept and their addition was
known much earlier ever since the time of Aristotle (384-322 B.C.), a Greek
philosopher, and pupil of Plato (427-348 B.C.). That time it was supposed to be
known that the combined action of two or more forces could be seen by adding
them according to parallelogram law. The correct law for the composition of
forces, that forces add vectorially, had been discovered in the case of perpendicular
forces by Stevin-Simon (1548-1620). In 1586 A.D., he analysed the principle of
geometric addition of forces in his treatise DeBeghinselen der Weeghconst
(“Principles of the Art of Weighing”), which caused a major breakthrough in the
development of mechanics. But it took another 200 years for the general concept
of vectors to form.
In the 1880, Josaih Willard Gibbs (1839-1903), an American physicist and
mathematician, and Oliver Heaviside (1850-1925), an English engineer, created
what we now know as vector analysis, essentially by separating the real (scalar)

part of quaternion from its imaginary (vector) part. In 1881 and 1884, Gibbs
printed a treatise entitled Element of Vector Analysis. This book gave a systematic
and concise account of vectors. However, much of the credit for demonstrating
the applications of vectors is due to the D. Heaviside and P.G. Tait (1831-1901)
who contributed significantly to this subject.
