Originally the name transition metals was derived
and chemical behaviour.
from the fact that their chemical properties were
transitional between those of s and p-block elements.
Now according to IUPAC, transition metals are defined
as metals which have incomplete d subshell either in
neutral atom or in their ions. Zinc, cadmium and
mercury of group 12 have full d10 configuration in their
ground state as well as in their common oxidation states
and hence, are not regarded as transition metals.
However, being the end members of the 3d, 4d and 5d
transition series, respectively, their chemistry is studied
along with the chemistry of the transition metals.
The presence of partly filled d or f orbitals in their
atoms makes transition elements different from that of
Rationalised 2023-24the non-transition elements. Hence, transition elements
and their compounds are studied separately. However,
the usual theory of valence as applicable to the non-
transition elements can be applied successfully to the
transition elements also.
Various precious metals such as silver, gold and
platinum and industrially important metals like iron,
copper and titanium belong to the transition metals series.
In this Unit, we shall first deal with the electronic
configuration, occurrence and general characteristics of
transition elements with special emphasis on the trends
in the properties of the first row (3d) transition metals
along with the preparation and properties of some
important compounds. This will be followed by
consideration of certain general aspects such as electronic
configurations, oxidation states and chemical reactivity
of the inner transition metals.

of the penultimate energy level of atoms receive electrons giving rise to
four rows of the transition metals, i.e., 3d, 4d, 5d and 6d. All these
series of transition elements are shown in Table 4.1.
In general the electronic configuration of outer orbitals of these elements

little energy difference between (n-1)d and ns orbitals. Furthermore,
half and completely filled sets of orbitals are relatively more stable. A
consequence of this factor is reflected in the electronic configurations
of Cr and Cu in the 3d series. For example, consider the case of Cr,
which has 3d5 4s1 configuration instead of 3d44s2; the energy gap
between the two sets (3d and 4s) of orbitals is small enough to prevent
electron entering the 3d orbitals. Similarly in case of Cu, the
configuration is 3d104s1 and not 3d94s2. The ground state electronic
configurations of the outer orbitals of transition elements are given in
Table 4.1.

The electronic configurations of outer orbitals of Zn, Cd, Hg and Cn
are represented by the general formula (n-1)d10ns2. The orbitals in
these elements are completely filled in the ground state as well as in
their common oxidation states. Therefore, they are not regarded as
transition elements.
The d orbitals of the transition elements protrude to the periphery of
an atom more than the other orbitals (i.e., s and p), hence, they are more
influenced by the surroundings as well as affect the atoms or molecules
surrounding them. In some respects, ions of a given dn configuration
(n = 1 – 9) have similar magnetic and electronic properties. With partly
filled d orbitals these elements exhibit certain characteristic properties
such as display of a variety of oxidation states, formation of coloured
ions and entering into complex formation with a variety of ligands.
The transition metals and their compounds also exhibit catalytic
property and paramagnetic behaviour. All these characteristics have
been discussed in detail later in this Unit.
There are greater similarities in the properties of the transition
elements of a horizontal row in contrast to the non-transition elements.
However, some group similarities also exist. We shall first study the
general characteristics and their trends in the horizontal rows
(particularly 3d row) and then consider some group similarities.

in its ground state (3d1), it is regarded as a transition element. On the
other hand, zinc atom has completely filled d orbitals (3d10) in its
ground state as well as in its oxidised state, hence it is not regarded
as a transition element.

Rationalised 2023-24favourable for strong interatomic interaction. In general, greater the
number of valence electrons, stronger is the resultant bonding. Since
the enthalpy of atomisation is an important factor in determining the
standard electrode potential of a metal, metals with very high enthalpy
of atomisation (i.e., very high boiling point) tend to be noble in their
reactions (see later for electrode potentials).
Another generalisation that may be drawn from Fig. 4.2 is that the
metals of the second and third series have greater enthalpies of
atomisation than the corresponding elements of the first series; this is an
important factor in accounting for the occurrence of much more frequent
metal – metal bonding in compounds of the heavy transition metals.

Transition not that effective, hence the net electrostatic attraction between the
Metals nuclear charge and the outermost electron increases and the ionic
radius decreases. The same trend is observed in the atomic radii of a
given series. However, the variation within a series is quite small. An
interesting point emerges when atomic sizes of one series are compared
with those of the corresponding elements in the other series. The curves
in Fig. 4.3 show an increase from the first (3d) to the second (4d) series
of the elements but the radii of the third (5d) series are virtually the
same as those of the corresponding members of the second series. This
phenomenon is associated with the intervention of the 4f orbitals which
must be filled before the 5d series of elements begin. The filling of 4f
before 5d orbital results in a regular decrease in atomic radii called
Lanthanoid contraction which essentially compensates for the expected

a
Rationalised 2023-24increase in atomic size with increasing atomic number. The net result
of the lanthanoid contraction is that the second and the third d series
exhibit similar radii (e.g., Zr 160 pm, Hf 159 pm) and have very similar
physical and chemical properties much more than that expected on
the basis of usual family relationship.
19 The factor responsible for the lanthanoid
contraction is somewhat similar to that observed
18
in an ordinary transition series and is attributed
to similar cause, i.e., the imperfect shielding of
16 one electron by another in the same set of orbitals.
However, the shielding of one 4f electron by
15
another is less than that of one d electron by
another, and as the nuclear charge increases
along the series, there is fairly regular decrease
13
in the size of the entire 4f n orbitals.

4.2 In the series Sc (Z = 21) to Zn (Z = 30), the enthalpy of atomisation
of zinc is the lowest, i.e., 126 kJ mol–1. Why?
4.3.3 Ionisation There is an increase in ionisation enthalpy along each series of the
Enthalpies transition elements from left to right due to an increase in nuclear
charge which accompanies the filling of the inner d orbitals. Table
4.2 gives the values of the first three ionisation enthalpies of the first
series of transition elements. These values show that the successive
enthalpies of these elements do not increase as steeply as in the case
of non-transition elements. The variation in ionisation enthalpy along
a series of transition elements is much less in comparison to the variation
along a period of non-transition elements. The first ionisation enthalpy,
in general, increases, but the magnitude of the increase in the second
and third ionisation enthalpies for the successive elements, is much
higher along a series.
The irregular trend in the first ionisation enthalpy of the metals of
3d series, though of little chemical significance, can be accounted for
by considering that the removal of one electron alters the relative energies
of 4s and 3d orbitals. You have learnt that when d-block elements form
ions, ns electrons are lost before (n – 1) d electrons. As we move along
the period in 3d series, we see that nuclear charge increases from
scandium to zinc but electrons are added to the orbital of inner subshell,
i.e., 3d orbitals. These 3d electrons shield the 4s electrons from the
increasing nuclear charge somewhat more effectively than the outer
shell electrons can shield one another. Therefore, the atomic radii
decrease less rapidly. Thus, ionization energies increase only slightly
along the 3d series. The doubly or more highly charged ions have dn
configurations with no 4s electrons. A general trend of increasing values
of second ionisation enthalpy is expected as the effective nuclear charge
increases because one d electron does not shield another electron from
the influence of nuclear charge because d-orbitals differ in direction.
However, the trend of steady increase in second and third ionisation
enthalpy breaks for the formation of Mn2+ and Fe3+ respectively. In both
the cases, ions have d5 configuration. Similar breaks occur at
corresponding elements in the later transition series.
The interpretation of variation in ionisation enthalpy for an electronic
configuration dn is as follows:
The three terms responsible for the value of ionisation enthalpy are
attraction of each electron towards nucleus, repulsion between the
95 The d- and f- Block Elements
Rationalised 2023-24electrons and the exchange energy. Exchange energy is responsible for
the stabilisation of energy state. Exchange energy is approximately
proportional to the total number of possible pairs of parallel spins in
the degenerate orbitals. When several electrons occupy a set of
degenerate orbitals, the lowest energy state corresponds to the maximum
possible extent of single occupation of orbital and parallel spins (Hunds
rule). The loss of exchange energy increases the stability. As the stability
increases, the ionisation becomes more difficult. There is no loss of
exchange energy at d6 configuration. Mn+ has 3d54s1 configuration and
configuration of Cr+ is d5, therefore, ionisation enthalpy of Mn+ is lower
than Cr+. In the same way, Fe2+ has d6 configuration and Mn2+ has 3d5
configuration. Hence, ionisation enthalpy of Fe2+ is lower than the Mn2+.
In other words, we can say that the third ionisation enthalpy of Fe is
lower than that of Mn.
The lowest common oxidation state of these metals is +2. To
form the M2+ ions from the gaseous atoms, the sum of the first and
second ionisation enthalpy is required in addition to the enthalpy of
atomisation. The dominant term is the second ionisation enthalpy
which shows unusually high values for Cr and Cu where M+ ions
have the d5 and d10 configurations respectively. The value for Zn is
correspondingly low as the ionisation causes the removal of one 4s
electron which results in the formation of stable d10 configuration.
The trend in the third ionisation enthalpies is not complicated by
the 4s orbital factor and shows the greater difficulty of removing an
electron from the d5 (Mn2+) and d10 (Zn2+) ions. In general, the third
ionisation enthalpies are quite high. Also the high values for third
ionisation enthalpies of copper, nickel and zinc indicate why it is
difficult to obtain oxidation state greater than two for these elements.
Although ionisation enthalpies give some guidance concerning the
relative stabilities of oxidation states, this problem is very complex and
not amenable to ready generalisation.

Chemistry 96
Rationalised 2023-24The elements which give the greatest number of oxidation states
occur in or near the middle of the series. Manganese, for example,
exhibits all the oxidation states from +2 to +7. The lesser number of
oxidation states at the extreme ends stems from either too few electrons
to lose or share (Sc, Ti) or too many d electrons (hence fewer orbitals
available in which to share electrons with others) for higher valence
(Cu, Zn). Thus, early in the series scandium(II) is virtually unknown
and titanium (IV) is more stable than Ti(III) or Ti(II). At the other end,
the only oxidation state of zinc is +2 (no d electrons are involved). The
maximum oxidation states of reasonable stability correspond in value
to the sum of the s and d electrons upto manganese (TiIVO , VVO +,
2 2
CrV1O 2–, MnVIIO –) followed by a rather abrupt decrease in stability of
4 4
higher oxidation states, so that the typical species to follow are FeII,III,
CoII,III, NiII, CuI,II, ZnII.
The variability of oxidation states, a characteristic of transition
elements, arises out of incomplete filling of d orbitals in such a way
that their oxidation states differ from each other by unity, e.g., VII, VIII,
VIV, VV. This is in contrast with the variability of oxidation states of non
transition elements where oxidation states normally differ by a unit
of two.
An interesting feature in the variability of oxidation states of the d–
block elements is noticed among the groups (groups 4 through 10).
Although in the p–block the lower oxidation states are favoured by the
heavier members (due to inert pair effect), the opposite is true in the
groups of d-block. For example, in group 6, Mo(VI) and W(VI) are
found to be more stable than Cr(VI). Thus Cr(VI) in the form of dichromate
in acidic medium is a strong oxidising agent, whereas MoO and WO
3 3
are not.
Low oxidation states are found when a complex compound has
ligands capable of p-acceptor character in addition to the s-bonding.
For example, in Ni(CO) and Fe(CO) , the oxidation state of nickel and
4 5
iron is zero.

However, many copper (I) compounds are unstable in aqueous
solution and undergo disproportionation.
2Cu+ fi Cu2+ + Cu
The stability of Cu2+ (aq) rather than Cu+(aq) is due to the much
more negative D Ho of Cu2+ (aq) than Cu+, which more than
hyd
compensates for the second ionisation enthalpy of Cu.
The ability of oxygen to stabilise the highest oxidation state is
demonstrated in the oxides. The highest oxidation number in the oxides
(Table 4.6) coincides with the group number and is attained in Sc O
2 3
to Mn O . Beyond Group 7, no higher oxides of Fe above Fe O , are
2 7 2 3
known, although ferrates (VI)(FeO )2–, are formed in alkaline media but

they readily decompose to Fe O and O . Besides the oxides, oxocations
2 3 2
stabilise Vv as VO +, VIV as VO2+ and TiIV as TiO2+. The ability of oxygen
2
to stabilise these high oxidation states exceeds that of fluorine. Thus
the highest Mn fluoride is MnF whereas the highest oxide is Mn O .

The ability of oxygen to form multiple bonds to metals explains its
superiority. In the covalent oxide Mn O , each Mn is tetrahedrally

4.5 How would you account for the irregular variation of ionisation
enthalpies (first and second) in the first series of the transition elements?
Chemistry 100
Rationalised 2023-244.3.8 Chemical Transition metals vary widely in their chemical reactivity. Many of
Reactivity them are sufficiently electropositive to dissolve in mineral acids, although
and Eo a few are ‘noble’—that is, they are unaffected by single acids.
Values The metals of the first series with the exception of copper are relatively
more reactive and are oxidised by 1M H+, though the actual rate at
which these metals react with oxidising agents like hydrogen ion (H+) is
sometimes slow. For example, titanium and vanadium, in practice, are
passive to dilute non oxidising acids at room temperature. The Eo values
for M2+/M (Table 4.2) indicate a decreasing tendency to form divalent
cations across the series. This general trend towards less negative Eo
values is related to the increase in the sum of the first and second
ionisation enthalpies. It is interesting to note that the Eo values for Mn,
Ni and Zn are more negative than expected from the general trend.
Whereas the stabilities of half-filled d subshell (d5) in Mn2+ and completely
filled d subshell (d10) in zinc are related to their E e values; for nickel, Eo
value is related to the highest negative enthalpy of hydration.
An examination of the Eo values for the redox couple M3+/M2+ (Table
4.2) shows that Mn3+ and Co3+ ions are the strongest oxidising agents
in aqueous solutions. The ions Ti2+, V2+ and Cr2+ are strong reducing
agents and will liberate hydrogen from a dilute acid, e.g.,
2 Cr2+(aq) + 2 H+(aq) fi 2 Cr3+(aq) + H (g)

EEEEExxxxxaaaaammmmmpppppllllleeeee 44444.....66666 For the first row transition metals the Eo values are:
Eo V Cr Mn Fe Co Ni Cu
(M2+/M) –1.18 – 0.91 –1.18 – 0.44 – 0.28 – 0.25 +0.34
Explain the irregularity in the above values.
SSSSSooooollllluuuuutttttiiiiiooooonnnnn The Eo (M2+/M) values are not regular which can be explained from
the irregular variation of ionisation enthalpies ( H  H ) and also
i 1 i 2
the sublimation enthalpies which are relatively much less for
manganese and vanadium.
EEEEExxxxxaaaaammmmmpppppllllleeeee 44444.....77777 Why is the Eo value for the Mn3+/Mn2+ couple much more positive
than that for Cr3+/Cr2+ or Fe3+/Fe2+? Explain.
SSSSSooooollllluuuuutttttiiiiiooooonnnnn Much larger third ionisation energy of Mn (where the required change
is d5 to d4) is mainly responsible for this. This also explains why the
+3 state of Mn is of little importance.

4.3.9 Magnetic When a magnetic field is applied to substances, mainly two types of
Properties magnetic behaviour are observed: diamagnetism and paramagnetism.
Diamagnetic substances are repelled by the applied field while the
paramagnetic substances are attracted. Substances which are
101 The d- and f- Block Elements
Rationalised 2023-24attracted very strongly are said to be ferromagnetic. In fact,
ferromagnetism is an extreme form of paramagnetism. Many of the
transition metal ions are paramagnetic.
Paramagnetism arises from the presence of unpaired electrons, each
such electron having a magnetic moment associated with its spin angular
momentum and orbital angular momentum. For the compounds of the
first series of transition metals, the contribution of the orbital angular
momentum is effectively quenched and hence is of no significance. For
these, the magnetic moment is determined by the number of unpaired
electrons and is calculated by using the ‘spin-only’ formula, i.e.,
  nn2
where n is the number of unpaired electrons and µ is the magnetic
moment in units of Bohr magneton (BM). A single unpaired electron
has a magnetic moment of 1.73 Bohr magnetons (BM).
The magnetic moment increases with the increasing number of
unpaired electrons. Thus, the observed magnetic moment gives a useful
indication about the number of unpaired electrons present in the atom,
molecule or ion. The magnetic moments calculated from the ‘spin-only’
formula and those derived experimentally for some ions of the first row
transition elements are given in Table 4.7. The experimental data are
mainly for hydrated ions in solution or in the solid state.

103 The d- and f- Block Elements
Rationalised 2023-24dealt with in detail in Unit 5). The transition metals form a large
number of complex compounds. This is due to the comparatively
smaller sizes of the metal ions, their high ionic charges and the
availability of d orbitals for bond formation.
4.3.12 Catalytic The transition metals and their compounds are known for their catalytic
Properties activity. This activity is ascribed to their ability to adopt multiple
oxidation states and to form complexes. Vanadium(V) oxide (in Contact
Process), finely divided iron (in Haber’s Process), and nickel (in Catalytic
Hydrogenation) are some of the examples. Catalysts at a solid surface
involve the formation of bonds between reactant molecules and atoms
of the surface of the catalyst (first row transition metals utilise 3d and
4s electrons for bonding). This has the effect of increasing the
concentration of the reactants at the catalyst surface and also weakening
of the bonds in the reacting molecules (the activation energy is lowering).
Also because the transition metal ions can change their oxidation states,
they become more effective as catalysts. For example, iron(III) catalyses
the reaction between iodide and persulphate ions.

4.3.13 Formation Interstitial compounds are those which are formed when small atoms

Compounds for example, TiC, Mn N, Fe H, VH . and TiH , etc. The formulas
4 3 0 56 1.7
quoted do not, of course, correspond to any normal oxidation state of
the metal. Because of the nature of their composition, these compounds
are referred to as interstitial compounds. The principal physical and
chemical characteristics of these compounds are as follows:
(i) They have high melting points, higher than those of pure metals.
(ii) They are very hard, some borides approach diamond in hardness.
(iii) They retain metallic conductivity.
(iv) They are chemically inert.
4.3.14 Alloy An alloy is a blend of metals prepared by mixing the components.
Formation Alloys may be homogeneous solid solutions in which the atoms of one
metal are distributed randomly among the atoms of the other. Such
alloys are formed by atoms with metallic radii that are within about 15
percent of each other. Because of similar radii and other characteristics
of transition metals, alloys are readily formed by these metals. The
alloys so formed are hard and have often high melting points. The best
known are ferrous alloys: chromium, vanadium, tungsten, molybdenum
and manganese are used for the production of a variety of steels and
stainless steel. Alloys of transition metals with non transition metals
such as brass (copper-zinc) and bronze (copper-tin), are also of
considerable industrial importance.

EEEEEllllleeeeemmmmmeeeeennnnntttttsssss 2 3
Mn O . Beyond group 7, no higher oxides of iron above Fe O are
2 7 2 3
known. Besides the oxides, the oxocations stabilise VV as VO +, VIV as
2
VO2+ and TiIV as TiO2+.
As the oxidation number of a metal increases, ionic character
decreases. In the case of Mn, Mn O is a covalent green oil. Even CrO
2 7 3
and V O have low melting points. In these higher oxides, the acidic
2 5
character is predominant.
Thus, Mn O gives HMnO and CrO gives H CrO and H Cr O .
2 7 4 3 2 4 2 2 7
V O is, however, amphoteric though mainly acidic and it gives VO 3– as
2 5 4
well as VO + salts. In vanadium there is gradual change from the basic
2
V O to less basic V O and to amphoteric V O . V O dissolves in acids
2 3 2 4 2 5 2 4
to give VO2+ salts. Similarly, V O reacts with alkalies as well as acids

to giveVO3 andVO respectively. The well characterised CrO is basic

but Cr O is amphoteric.

Potassium dichromate K Cr O
2 2 7
Potassium dichromate is a very important chemical used in leather
industry and as an oxidant for preparation of many azo compounds.
Dichromates are generally prepared from chromate, which in turn are
obtained by the fusion of chromite ore (FeCr O ) with sodium or
2 4
potassium carbonate in free access of air. The reaction with sodium
carbonate occurs as follows:
4 FeCr O + 8 Na CO + 7 O fi 8 Na CrO + 2 Fe O + 8 CO
2 4 2 3 2 2 4 2 3 2
The yellow solution of sodium chromate is filtered and acidified
with sulphuric acid to give a solution from which orange sodium
dichromate, Na Cr O .2H O can be crystallised.

2 2 7 2 2 7
Orange crystals of potassium dichromate crystallise out. The
chromates and dichromates are interconvertible in aqueous solution

in chromate and dichromate is the same.

The structures of

the dichromate ion, Cr O 2–
2 7
are shown below. The
chromate ion is tetrahedral
whereas the dichromate ion
consists of two tetrahedra
sharing one corner with
Cr–O–Cr bond angle of 126°.
Sodium and potassium dichromates are strong oxidising agents;
the sodium salt has a greater solubility in water and is extensively
used as an oxidising agent in organic chemistry. Potassium dichromate
is used as a primary standard in volumetric analysis. In acidic solution,
its oxidising action can be represented as follows:
Cr O 2– + 14H+ + 6e– fi 2Cr3+ + 7H O (Eo = 1.33V)
2 7 2
Thus, acidified potassium dichromate will oxidise iodides to iodine,
sulphides to sulphur, tin(II) to tin(IV) and iron(II) salts to iron(III). The
half-reactions are noted below:
6 I– fi 3I + 6 e–; 3 Sn2+ fi 3Sn4+ + 6 e–

3 H S fi 6H+ + 3S + 6e–; 6 Fe2+ fi 6Fe3+ + 6 e–

The full ionic equation may be obtained by adding the half-reaction for
potassium dichromate to the half-reaction for the reducing agent, for e.g.,
Cr O 2– + 14 H+ + 6 Fe2+ fi 2 Cr3+ + 6 Fe3+ + 7 H O

It has two physical properties of considerable interest: its intense colour
and its diamagnetism along with temperature-dependent weak
paramagnetism. These can be explained by the use of molecular orbital
theory which is beyond the present scope.
The manganate and permanganate ions are tetrahedral; the p-
bonding takes place by overlap of p orbitals of oxygen with d orbitals
of manganese. The green manganate is paramagnetic because of one
unpaired electron but the permanganate is diamagnetic due to the
absence of unpaired electron.
Acidified permanganate solution oxidises oxalates to carbon dioxide,
iron(II) to iron(III), nitrites to nitrates and iodides to free iodine.

The full reaction can be written by adding the half-reaction for
KMnO to the half-reaction of the reducing agent, balancing wherever

necessary.

manganese dioxide and manganese(II) salt by half-reactions,

MnO – + 8H+ + 5e– fi Mn2+ + 4H O (Eo = + 1.52 V)
4 2
We can very well see that the hydrogen ion concentration of the
solution plays an important part in influencing the reaction. Although
many reactions can be understood by consideration of redox potential,
kinetics of the reaction is also an important factor. Permanganate at
[H+] = 1 should oxidise water but in practice the reaction is extremely slow
unless either manganese(ll) ions are present or the temperature is raised.

Note: Permanganate titrations in presence of hydrochloric acid are
unsatisfactory since hydrochloric acid is oxidised to chlorine.
UUUUUssssseeeeesssss: Besides its use in analytical chemistry, potassium permanganate is
used as a favourite oxidant in preparative organic chemistry. Its uses for the
bleaching of wool, cotton, silk and other textile fibres and for the decolourisation
of oils are also dependent on its strong oxidising power.
THE INNER TRANSITION ELEMENTS ( f-BLOCK)
The f-block consists of the two series, lanthanoids (the fourteen elements
following lanthanum) and actinoids (the fourteen elements following
actinium). Because lanthanum closely resembles the lanthanoids, it is
usually included in any discussion of the lanthanoids for which the
general symbol Ln is often used. Similarly, a discussion of the actinoids
includes actinium besides the fourteen elements constituting the series.
The lanthanoids resemble one another more closely than do the members
of ordinary transition elements in any series. They have only one stable
oxidation state and their chemistry provides an excellent opportunity to
examine the effect of small changes in size and nuclear charge along a
series of otherwise similar elements. The chemistry of the actinoids is, on
the other hand, much more complicated. The complication arises partly
owing to the occurrence of a wide range of oxidation states in these
elements and partly because their radioactivity creates special problems
in their study; the two series will be considered separately here.

chemistry of the lanthanoids. It has far reaching
consequences in the chemistry of the third
+
transition series of the elements. The decrease
in atomic radii (derived from the structures of
metals) is not quite regular as it is regular in
M3+ ions (Fig. 4.6). This contraction is, of
course, similar to that observed in an ordinary
transition series and is attributed to the same
cause, the imperfect shielding of one electron
by another in the same sub-shell. However, the
shielding of one 4 f electron by another is less
than one d electron by another with the increase
in nuclear charge along the series. There is
fairly regular decrease in the sizes with
increasing atomic number.
The cumulative effect of the contraction of
the lanthanoid series, known as lanthanoid
contraction, causes the radii of the members
of the third transition series to be very similar
to those of the corresponding members of the
second series. The almost identical radii of Zr
(160 pm) and Hf (159 pm), a consequence of
the lanthanoid contraction, account for their

Fig. 4.6: Trends in ionic radii of lanthanoids difficulty faced in their separation.
4.5.3 Oxidation In the lanthanoids, La(II) and Ln(III) compounds are predominant
States species. However, occasionally +2 and +4 ions in solution or in solid
compounds are also obtained. This irregularity (as in ionisation
enthalpies) arises mainly from the extra stability of empty, half-filled
or filled f subshell. Thus, the formation of CeIV is favoured by its
noble gas configuration, but it is a strong oxidant reverting to the
common +3 state. The Eo value for Ce4+/ Ce3+ is + 1.74 V which
suggests that it can oxidise water. However, the reaction rate is very
slow and hence Ce(IV) is a good analytical reagent. Pr, Nd, Tb and Dy
also exhibit +4 state but only in oxides, MO . Eu2+ is formed by losing
2
the two s electrons and its f 7 configuration accounts for the formation
of this ion. However, Eu2+ is a strong reducing agent changing to the
common +3 state. Similarly Yb2+ which has f 14 configuration is a
reductant. TbIV has half-filled f-orbitals and is an oxidant. The
behaviour of samarium is very much like europium, exhibiting both
+2 and +3 oxidation states.

4.5.4 General All the lanthanoids are silvery white soft metals and tarnish rapidly in air.
Characteristics The hardness increases with increasing atomic number, samarium being
steel hard. Their melting points range between 1000 to 1200 K but
samarium melts at 1623 K. They have typical metallic structure and are
good conductors of heat and electricity. Density and other properties
change smoothly except for Eu and Yb and occasionally for Sm and Tm.
Many trivalent lanthanoid ions are coloured both in the solid state
and in aqueous solutions. Colour of these ions may be attributed to
the presence of f electrons. Neither La3+ nor Lu3+ ion shows any colour
but the rest do so. However, absorption bands are narrow, probably
because of the excitation within f level. The lanthanoid ions other
than the f 0 type (La3+ and Ce4+) and the f 14 type (Yb2+ and Lu3+) are
all paramagnetic.
The first ionisation enthalpies of the lanthanoids are around
600 kJ mol–1, the second about 1200 kJ mol–1 comparable with those
of calcium. A detailed discussion of the variation of the third ionisation
enthalpies indicates that the exchange enthalpy considerations (as in
3d orbitals of the first transition series), appear to impart a certain
degree of stability to empty, half-filled and completely filled orbitals
f level. This is indicated from the abnormally low value of the third
ionisation enthalpy of lanthanum, gadolinium and lutetium.
In their chemical behaviour, in general, the earlier members of the series
are quite reactive similar to calcium but, with increasing atomic number,
they behave more like aluminium. Values for Eo for the half-reaction:

well known alloy is mischmetall which consists of a lanthanoid metal
(~ 95%) and iron (~ 5%) and traces of S, C, Ca and Al. A good deal of
mischmetall is used in Mg-based alloy to produce bullets, shell and
lighter flint. Mixed oxides of lanthanoids are employed as catalysts in
petroleum cracking. Some individual Ln oxides are used as phosphors
in television screens and similar fluorescing surfaces.

Rationalised 2023-24The actinoids are radioactive elements and the earlier members have
relatively long half-lives, the latter ones have half-life values ranging from
a day to 3 minutes for lawrencium (Z =103). The latter members could be
prepared only in nanogram quantities. These facts render their study
more difficult.
4.6.1 Electronic All the actinoids are believed to have the electronic configuration of 7s2
Configurations and variable occupancy of the 5f and 6d subshells. The fourteen electrons
are formally added to 5f, though not in thorium (Z = 90) but from Pa
onwards the 5f orbitals are complete at element 103. The irregularities in
the electronic configurations of the actinoids, like those in the lanthanoids
are related to the stabilities of the f 0, f 7 and f 14 occupancies of the 5f
orbitals. Thus, the configurations of Am and Cm are [Rn] 5f 77s2 and
[Rn] 5f 76d17s2. Although the 5f orbitals resemble the 4f orbitals in their
angular part of the wave-function, they are not as buried as 4f orbitals
and hence 5f electrons can participate in bonding to a far greater extent.
4.6.2 Ionic Sizes The general trend in lanthanoids is observable in the actinoids as well.
There is a gradual decrease in the size of atoms or M3+ ions across the
series. This may be referred to as the actinoid contraction (like lanthanoid
contraction). The contraction is, however, greater from element to element
in this series resulting from poor shielding by 5f electrons.
4.6.3 Oxidation There is a greater range of oxidation states, which is in part attributed to
States the fact that the 5f, 6d and 7s levels are of comparable energies. The
known oxidation states of actinoids are listed in Table 4.11.
The actinoids show in general +3 oxidation state. The elements, in the
first half of the series frequently exhibit higher oxidation states. For example,
the maximum oxidation state increases from +4 in Th to +5, +6 and +7
respectively in Pa, U and Np but decreases in succeeding elements (Table
4.11). The actinoids resemble the lanthanoids in having more compounds
in +3 state than in the +4 state. However, +3 and +4 ions tend to hydrolyse.
Because the distribution of oxidation states among the actinoids is so
uneven and so different for the former and later elements, it is unsatisfactory
to review their chemistry in terms of oxidation states.

4.6.4 General The actinoid metals are all silvery in appearance but display
Characteristics a variety of structures. The structural variability is obtained
and Comparison due to irregularities in metallic radii which are far greater
with Lanthanoids than in lanthanoids.
Chemistry 112
Rationalised 2023-24The actinoids are highly reactive metals, especially when finely divided.
The action of boiling water on them, for example, gives a mixture of oxide
and hydride and combination with most non metals takes place at
moderate temperatures. Hydrochloric acid attacks all metals but most are
slightly affected by nitric acid owing to the formation of protective oxide
layers; alkalies have no action.
The magnetic properties of the actinoids are more complex than those
of the lanthanoids. Although the variation in the magnetic susceptibility
of the actinoids with the number of unpaired 5 f electrons is roughly
parallel to the corresponding results for the lanthanoids, the latter have
higher values.
It is evident from the behaviour of the actinoids that the ionisation
enthalpies of the early actinoids, though not accurately known, but are
lower than for the early lanthanoids. This is quite reasonable since it is to
be expected that when 5f orbitals are beginning to be occupied, they will
penetrate less into the inner core of electrons. The 5f electrons, will therefore,
be more effectively shielded from the nuclear charge than the 4f electrons
of the corresponding lanthanoids. Because the outer electrons are less
firmly held, they are available for bonding in the actinoids.
A comparison of the actinoids with the lanthanoids, with respect to
different characteristics as discussed above, reveals that behaviour similar
to that of the lanthanoids is not evident until the second half of the
actinoid series. However, even the early actinoids resemble the lanthanoids
in showing close similarities with each other and in gradual variation in
properties which do not entail change in oxidation state. The lanthanoid
and actinoid contractions, have extended effects on the sizes, and
therefore, the properties of the elements succeeding them in their
respective periods. The lanthanoid contraction is more important because
the chemistry of elements succeeding the actinoids are much less known
at the present time.

The d-block consisting of Groups 3-12 occupies the large middle section of the periodic
table. In these elements the inner d orbitals are progressively filled. The f-block is placed
outside at the bottom of the periodic table and in the elements of this block, 4f and
5f orbitals are progressively filled.
Corresponding to the filling of 3d, 4d and 5d orbitals, three series of transition
elements are well recognised. All the transition elements exhibit typical metallic properties
such as –high tensile strength, ductility, malleability, thermal and electrical conductivity
and metallic character. Their melting and boiling points are high which are attributed
to the involvement of (n–1)d electrons resulting into strong interatomic bonding. In
many of these properties, the maxima occur at about the middle of each series which
indicates that one unpaired electron per d orbital is particularly a favourable configuration
for strong interatomic interaction.
Successive ionisation enthalpies do not increase as steeply as in the main group
elements with increasing atomic number. Hence, the loss of variable number of electrons
from (n–1)d orbitals is not energetically unfavourable. The involvement of (n–1)d electrons
in the behaviour of transition elements impart certain distinct characteristics to these
elements. Thus, in addition to variable oxidation states, they exhibit paramagnetic
behaviour, catalytic properties and tendency for the formation of coloured ions, interstitial
compounds and complexes.
The transition elements vary widely in their chemical behaviour. Many of them are
sufficiently electropositive to dissolve in mineral acids, although a few are ‘noble’. Of the
first series, with the exception of copper, all the metals are relatively reactive.
The transition metals react with a number of non-metals like oxygen, nitrogen,
sulphur and halogens to form binary compounds. The first series transition metal oxides
are generally formed from the reaction of metals with oxygen at high temperatures. These
oxides dissolve in acids and bases to form oxometallic salts. Potassium dichromate and
potassium permanganate are common examples. Potassium dichromate is prepared from
the chromite ore by fusion with alkali in presence of air and acidifying the extract.
Pyrolusite ore (MnO ) is used for the preparation of potassium permanganate. Both the
2
dichromate and the permanganate ions are strong oxidising agents.
The two series of inner transition elements, lanthanoids and actinoids constitute
the f-block of the periodic table. With the successive filling of the inner orbitals, 4f, there
is a gradual decrease in the atomic and ionic sizes of these metals along the series
(lanthanoid contraction). This has far reaching consequences in the chemistry of the
elements succeeding them. Lanthanum and all the lanthanoids are rather soft white
metals. They react easily with water to give solutions giving +3 ions. The principal
oxidation state is +3, although +4 and +2 oxidation states are also exhibited by some
Chemistry 114
Rationalised 2023-24occasionally. The chemistry of the actinoids is more complex in view of their ability to
exist in different oxidation states. Furthermore, many of the actinoid elements are radioactive
which make the study of these elements rather difficult.
There are many useful applications of the d- and f-block elements and their
compounds, notable among them being in varieties of steels, catalysts, complexes,
organic syntheses, etc.

Answers to Some Intext Questions
4.1 Silver (Z = 47) can exhibit +2 oxidation state wherein it will have
incompletely filled d-orbitals (4d), hence a transition element.
4.2 In the formation of metallic bonds, no eletrons from 3d-orbitals are involved
in case of zinc, while in all other metals of the 3d series, electrons from
the d-orbitals are always involved in the formation of metallic bonds.
4.3 Manganese (Z = 25), as its atom has the maximum number of unpaired
electrons.
4.5 Irregular variation of ionisation enthalpies is mainly attributed to varying
degree of stability of different 3d-configurations (e.g., d0, d5, d10 are
exceptionally stable).
4.6 Because of small size and high electronegativity oxygen or fluorine can
oxidise the metal to its highest oxidation state.
4.7 Cr2+ is stronger reducing agent than Fe2+
Reason: d4  d3 occurs in case of Cr2+ to Cr3+
But d6  d5 occurs in case of Fe2+ to Fe3+
In a medium (like water) d3 is more stable as compared to d5 (see CFSE)
