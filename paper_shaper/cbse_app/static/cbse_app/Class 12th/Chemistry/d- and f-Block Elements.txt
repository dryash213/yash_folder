Or what controls the rate at which fuel burns in an
auto engine? All these questions can be answered by
the branch of chemistry, which deals with the study
of reaction rates and their mechanisms, called
chemical kinetics. The word kinetics is derived from
the Greek word ‘kinesis’ meaning movement.
Thermodynamics tells only about the feasibility of a
reaction whereas chemical kinetics tells about the rate
of a reaction. For example, thermodynamic data
indicate that diamond shall convert to graphite but
in reality the conversion rate is so slow that the change
is not perceptible at all. Therefore, most people think
Rationalised 2023-24that diamond is forever. Kinetic studies not only help us to determine
the speed or rate of a chemical reaction but also describe the
conditions by which the reaction rates can be altered. The factors
such as concentration, temperature, pressure and catalyst affect the
rate of a reaction. At the macroscopic level, we are interested in
amounts reacted or formed and the rates of their consumption or
formation. At the molecular level, the reaction mechanisms involving
orientation and energy of molecules undergoing collisions,
are discussed.
In this Unit, we shall be dealing with average and instantaneous
rate of reaction and the factors affecting these. Some elementary
ideas about the collision theory of reaction rates are also given.
However, in order to understand all these, let us first learn about the
reaction rate.

Some reactions such as ionic reactions occur very fast, for example,

hand, some reactions are very slow, for example, rusting of iron in
the presence of air and moisture. Also there are reactions like inversion
of cane sugar and hydrolysis of starch, which proceed with a moderate
speed. Can you think of more examples from each category?
You must be knowing that speed of an automobile is expressed in
terms of change in the position or distance covered by it in a certain
period of time. Similarly, the speed of a reaction or the rate of a
reaction can be defined as the change in concentration of a reactant
or product in unit time. To be more specific, it can be expressed in
terms of:
(i) the rate of decrease in concentration of any one of the
reactants,or
(ii) the rate of increase in concentration of any one of the products.
Consider a hypothetical reaction, assuming that the volume of the
system remains constant.
R fi P
One mole of the reactant R produces one mole of the product P. If
[R] and [P] are the concentrations of R and P respectively at time t

and [R] and [P] are their concentrations at time t then,
2 2 2
Dt = t – t

D[R] = [R] – [R]

Since, D[R] is a negative quantity (as concentration of reactants is
decreasing), it is multiplied with –1 to make the rate of the reaction a
positive quantity.
Equations (3.1) and (3.2) given above represent the average rate of
a reaction, r .

Average rate depends upon the change in concentration of reactants
or products and the time taken for that change to occur (Fig. 3.1).

Units of rate of a reaction
From equations (3.1) and (3.2), it is clear that units of rate are
concentration time–1. For example, if concentration is in mol L–1 and
time is in seconds then the units will be mol L-1s–1. However, in gaseous
reactions, when the concentration of gases is expressed in terms of their
partial pressures, then the units of the rate equation will be atm s–1.

It can be seen (Table 3.1) that the average rate falls from 1.90× 0-4 mol L-1s-1 to
0.4 × 10-4 mol L-1s-1. However, average rate cannot be used to predict the
rate of a reaction at a particular instant as it would be constant for the
time interval for which it is calculated. So, to express the rate at a particular
moment of time we determine the instantaneous rate. It is obtained
when we consider the average rate at the smallest time interval say dt ( i.e.
when Dt approaches zero). Hence, mathematically for an infinitesimally
small dt instantaneous rate is given by

Rationalised 2023-24It can be determined graphically by drawing a tangent at time t on
either of the curves for concentration of R and P vs time t and calculating
its slope (Fig. 3.1). So in problem 3.1, r at 600s for example, can be

calculated by plotting concentration of butyl chloride as a function of
time. A tangent is drawn that touches the curve at t = 600 s (Fig. 3.2).

Now consider a reaction

Where stoichiometric coefficients of the reactants and products are
same, then rate of the reaction is given as

D Hg D Cl D HgCl
Rate of reaction = – = – 2 = 2

i.e., rate of disappearance of any of the reactants is same as the rate
of appearance of the products. But in the following reaction, two moles of
HI decompose to produce one mole each of H and I
2 2,
2HI(g) fi H (g) + I (g)
2 2
For expressing the rate of such a reaction where stoichiometric
coefficients of reactants or products are not equal to one, rate of
disappearance of any of the reactants or the rate of appearance of
products is divided by their respective stoichiometric coefficients. Since
rate of consumption of HI is twice the rate of formation of H or I , to
2 2
make them equal, the term D[HI] is divided by 2. The rate of this reaction
is given by

For a gaseous reaction at constant temperature, concentration is
directly proportional to the partial pressure of a species and hence, rate
can also be expressed as rate of change in partial pressure of the reactant
or the product.

Rate of reaction depends upon the experimental conditions such

temperature and catalyst.
3.2.1 Dependence The rate of a chemical reaction at a given temperature may depend on
of Rate on the concentration of one or more reactants and products. The
Concentration representation of rate of reaction in terms of concentration of the
reactants is known as rate law. It is also called as rate equation or
rate expression.
3.2.2 Rate The results in Table 3.1 clearly show that rate of a reaction decreases with
Expression the passage of time as the concentration of reactants decrease. Conversely,
and Rate rates generally increase when reactant concentrations increase. So, rate of
Constant a reaction depends upon the concentration of reactants.
Chemistry 66
Rationalised 2023-24Consider a general reaction
aA + bB fi cC + dD
where a, b, c and d are the stoichiometric coefficients of reactants
and products.
The rate expression for this reaction is
Rate (cid:181) [A]x [B]y (3.4)
where exponents x and y may or may not be equal to the
stoichiometric coefficients (a and b) of the reactants. Above equation
can also be written as
Rate = k [A]x [B]y (3.4a)
[ ]
- d R = k[ A]x[ B]y
(3.4b)
dt
This form of equation (3.4 b) is known as differential rate equation,
where k is a proportionality constant called rate constant. The
equation like (3.4), which relates the rate of a reaction to concentration
of reactants is called rate law or rate expression. Thus, rate law is the
expression in which reaction rate is given in terms of molar
concentration of reactants with each term raised to some
power, which may or may not be same as the stoichiometric
coefficient of the reacting species in a balanced chemical
equation. For example:
2NO(g) + O (g) fi 2NO (g)
2 2
We can measure the rate of this reaction as a function of initial
concentrations either by keeping the concentration of one of the reactants
constant and changing the concentration of the other reactant or by
changing the concentration of both the reactants. The following results
are obtained (Table 3.2).
Table 3.2: Initial rate of formation of NO

2. 0.60 0.30 0.384
3. 0.30 0.60 0.192
4. 0.60 0.60 0.768
It is obvious, after looking at the results, that when the concentration
of NO is doubled and that of O is kept constant then the initial rate
2
increases by a factor of four from 0.096 to 0.384 mol L–1s–1. This
indicates that the rate depends upon the square of the concentration of
NO. When concentration of NO is kept constant and concentration of
O is doubled the rate also gets doubled indicating that rate depends
2
on concentration of O to the first power. Hence, the rate equation for
2
this reaction will be
Rate = k [NO]2[O ]
2
67 Chemical Kinetics
Rationalised 2023-24The differential form of this rate expression is given as
[ ]
- d R = k[ NO]2[ O ]
dt 2
Now, we observe that for this reaction in the rate equation derived
from the experimental data, the exponents of the concentration terms
are the same as their stoichiometric coefficients in the balanced
chemical equation.
Some other examples are given below:
Reaction Experimental rate expression
1. CHCl + Cl fi CCl + HCl Rate = k [CHCl ] [Cl ]1/2
3 2 4 3 2
2. CHCOOCH + HO fi CHCOOH + CHOH Rate = k[CH COOCH ]1 [H O]0
3 2 5 2 3 2 5 3 2 5 2
In these reactions, the exponents of the concentration terms are not
the same as their stoichiometric coefficients. Thus, we can say that:
Rate law for any reaction cannot be predicted by merely looking at
the balanced chemical equation, i.e., theoretically but must be determined
experimentally.
3.2.3 Order of a In the rate equation (3.4)
Reaction Rate = k [A]x [B]y
x and y indicate how sensitive the rate is to the change in concentration
of A and B. Sum of these exponents, i.e., x + y in (3.4) gives the overall
order of a reaction whereas x and y represent the order with respect
to the reactants A and B respectively.
Hence, the sum of powers of the concentration of the
reactants in the rate law expression is called the order of that
chemical reaction.
Order of a reaction can be 0, 1, 2, 3 and even a fraction. A zero
order reaction means that the rate of reaction is independent of the
concentration of reactants.
EEEEExxxxxaaaaammmmmpppppllllleeeee 33333.....33333 Calculate the overall order of a reaction which
has the rate expression
(a) Rate = k [A]1/2 [B]3/2
(b) Rate = k [A]3/2 [B]–1
SSSSSooooollllluuuuutttttiiiiiooooonnnnn
(a) Rate = k [A]x [B]y
order = x + y
So order = 1/2 + 3/2 = 2, i.e., second order
(b) order = 3/2 + (–1) = 1/2, i.e., half order.
A balanced chemical equation never gives us a true picture of how
a reaction takes place since rarely a reaction gets completed in one
step. The reactions taking place in one step are called elementary
reactions. When a sequence of elementary reactions (called mechanism)
gives us the products, the reactions are called complex reactions.
Chemistry 68
Rationalised 2023-24These may be consecutive reactions (e.g., oxidation of ethane to CO
2
and H O passes through a series of intermediate steps in which alcohol,
2
aldehyde and acid are formed), reverse reactions and side reactions
(e.g., nitration of phenol yields o-nitrophenol and p-nitrophenol).

k = 2.3 × 10–5 L mol–1 s–1 represents a second order reaction.
(ii) The unit of a first order rate constant is s–1 therefore
k = 3 × 10–4 s–1 represents a first order reaction.
3.2.4 Molecularity Another property of a reaction called molecularity helps in
of a understanding its mechanism. The number of reacting species
Reaction (atoms, ions or molecules) taking part in an elementary
reaction, which must collide simultaneously in order to bring
about a chemical reaction is called molecularity of a reaction.
The reaction can be unimolecular when one reacting species is involved,
for example, decomposition of ammonium nitrite.
69 Chemical Kinetics
Rationalised 2023-24NH NO fi N + 2H O
4 2 2 2
Bimolecular reactions involve simultaneous collision between two
species, for example, dissociation of hydrogen iodide.
2HI fi H + I
2 2
Trimolecular or termolecular reactions involve simultaneous collision
between three reacting species, for example,
2NO + O fi 2NO
2 2
The probability that more than three molecules can collide and
react simultaneously is very small. Hence, reactions with the
molecularity three are very rare and slow to proceed.
It is, therefore, evident that complex reactions involving more than
three molecules in the stoichiometric equation must take place in more
than one step.
KClO + 6FeSO + 3H SO fi KCl + 3Fe (SO ) + 3H O
3 4 2 4 2 4 3 2
This reaction which apparently seems to be of tenth order is actually
a second order reaction. This shows that this reaction takes place in
several steps. Which step controls the rate of the overall reaction? The
question can be answered if we go through the mechanism of reaction,
for example, chances to win the relay race competition by a team
depend upon the slowest person in the team. Similarly, the overall rate
of the reaction is controlled by the slowest step in a reaction called the
rate determining step. Consider the decomposition of hydrogen
peroxide which is catalysed by iodide ion in an alkaline medium.

The rate equation for this reaction is found to be
dH O 
Rate  2 2 kH O  I
dt 2 2
This reaction is first order with respect to both H O and I–. Evidences
2 2
suggest that this reaction takes place in two steps
(1) H O + I– fi H O + IO–
2 2 2
(2) H O + IO– fi H O + I– + O
2 2 2 2
Both the steps are bimolecular elementary reactions. Species IO- is
called as an intermediate since it is formed during the course of the
reaction but not in the overall balanced equation. The first step, being
slow, is the rate determining step. Thus, the rate of formation of
intermediate will determine the rate of this reaction.
Thus, from the discussion, till now, we conclude the following:
(i) Order of a reaction is an experimental quantity. It can be zero and
even a fraction but molecularity cannot be zero or a non integer.
(ii) Order is applicable to elementary as well as complex reactions
whereas molecularity is applicable only for elementary reactions.
For complex reaction molecularity has no meaning.
Chemistry 70
Rationalised 2023-24(iii) For complex reaction, order is given by the slowest step and
molecularity of the slowest step is same as the order of the overall
reaction.

of slope of the tangent at point ‘t’ in concentration vs time plot
(Fig. 3.1). This makes it difficult to determine the rate law and hence
the order of the reaction. In order to avoid this difficulty, we can
integrate the differential rate equation to give a relation between directly
measured experimental data, i.e., concentrations at different times
and rate constant.
The integrated rate equations are different for the reactions of different
reaction orders. We shall determine these equations only for zero and
first order chemical reactions.

Zero order reactions are relatively uncommon but
they occur under special conditions. Some enzyme
catalysed reactions and reactions which occur on
metal surfaces are a few examples of zero order

on a hot platinum surface is a zero order reaction at
high pressure.

In this reaction, platinum metal acts as a catalyst. At high pressure,
the metal surface gets saturated with gas molecules. So, a further
change in reaction conditions is unable to alter the amount of ammonia
on the surface of the catalyst making rate of the reaction independent
of its concentration. The thermal decomposition of HI on gold surface
is another example of zero order reaction.
3.3.2 First Order In this class of reactions, the rate of the reaction is proportional to the

Integrating this equation, we get
ln [R] = –kt + I (3.8)
Again, I is the constant of integration and its value can be determined
easily.
When t = 0, R = [R] , where [R] is the initial concentration of the
0 0
reactant.
Therefore, equation (3.8) can be written as
ln [R] = –k × 0 + I
0
ln [R] = I

Substituting the value of I in equation (3.8)

Rationalised 2023-24The order of a reaction is sometimes altered by conditions. There
are many reactions which obey first order rate law although they are
higher order reactions. Consider the hydrolysis of ethyl acetate which
is a chemical reaction between ethyl acetate and water. In reality, it
is a second order reaction and concentration of both ethyl acetate and
water affect the rate of the reaction. But water is taken in large excess
for hydrolysis, therefore, concentration of water is not altered much
during the reaction. Thus, the rate of reaction is affected by
concentration of ethyl acetate only. For example, during the hydrolysis
of 0.01 mol of ethyl acetate with 10 mol of water, amounts of the
reactants and products at the beginning (t = 0) and completion (t) of

It has been found that for a chemical reaction with rise in
temperature by 10°, the rate constant is nearly doubled.
The temperature dependence of the rate of a chemical reaction can
be accurately explained by Arrhenius equation (3.18). It was first
proposed by Dutch chemist, J.H. van’t Hoff but Swedish chemist,
Arrhenius provided its physical justification and interpretation.

Some energy is released when the

So, the final enthalpy of the reaction
depends upon the nature of reactants
and products.
All the molecules in the reacting
species do not have the same kinetic

Catalyst itself undergoing any permanent chemical change. For example, MnO

catalyses the following reaction so as to increase its rate considerably.
2KClO Mn O 2 2 KCl + 3O
3 2
The word catalyst should not be used when the added substance
reduces the rate of raction. The substance is then called inhibitor. The
action of the catalyst can be explained by intermediate complex theory.
According to this theory, a catalyst participates in a chemical reaction by
forming temporary bonds with the reactants resulting in an intermediate
complex. This has a transitory existence and decomposes to yield products
and the catalyst.
It is believed that the catalyst provides an
alternate pathway or reaction mechanism by
reducing the activation energy between
reactants and products and hence lowering
the potential energy barrier as shown in
Fig. 3.11.
It is clear from Arrhenius equation (3.18)
that lower the value of activation energy faster
will be the rate of a reaction.
A small amount of the catalyst can catalyse
a large amount of reactants. A catalyst does

catalyses the spontaneous reactions but does
not catalyse non-spontaneous reactions. It is
also found that a catalyst does not change the equilibrium constant of
a reaction rather, it helps in attaining the equilibrium faster, that is, it
catalyses the forward as well as the backward reactions to the same
extent so that the equilibrium state remains same but is reached earlier.

theory of gases. According to this theory, the reactant molecules are
Chemistry 82
Rationalised 2023-24assumed to be hard spheres and reaction is postulated to occur when
molecules collide with each other. The number of collisions per
second per unit volume of the reaction mixture is known as
collision frequency (Z). Another factor which affects the rate of
chemical reactions is activation energy (as we have already studied).
For a bimolecular elementary reaction
A + B fi Products
rate of reaction can be expressed as
Rate = Z e- Ea/RT (3.23)
AB
where Z represents the collision frequency of reactants, A and B
AB
and e-Ea /RT represents the fraction of molecules with energies equal to
or greater than E . Comparing (3.23) with Arrhenius equation, we can
a
say that A is related to collision frequency.
Equation (3.23) predicts the value of rate constants fairly
accurately for the reactions that involve atomic species or simple
molecules but for complex molecules significant deviations are
observed. The reason could be that all collisions do not lead to the
formation of products. The collisions in which molecules collide with
sufficient kinetic energy (called threshold energy*) and proper
orientation, so as to facilitate breaking of bonds between reacting
species and formation of new bonds to form products are called as
effective collisions.
For example, formation of
methanol from bromoethane depends
upon the orientation of reactant
molecules as shown in
Fig. 3.12. The proper orientation of
reactant molecules lead to bond
formation whereas improper
orientation makes them simply
bounce back and no products are
formed.
Fig. 3.12:Diagram showing molecules having proper and
To account for effective collisions, improper orientation
another factor P, called the probability
or steric factor is introduced. It takes into account the fact that in a
collision, molecules must be properly oriented i.e.,
Rate = PZ e- Ea/RT
AB
Thus, in collision theory activation energy and proper orientation of
the molecules together determine the criteria for an effective collision
and hence the rate of a chemical reaction.
Collision theory also has certain drawbacks as it considers atoms/
molecules to be hard spheres and ignores their structural aspect. You
will study details about this theory and more on other theories in your
higher classes.

Chemical kinetics is the study of chemical reactions with respect to reaction
rates, effect of various variables, rearrangement of atoms and formation of
intermediates. The rate of a reaction is concerned with decrease in concentration
of reactants or increase in the concentration of products per unit time. It can
be expressed as instantaneous rate at a particular instant of time and average
rate over a large interval of time. A number of factors such as temperature,
concentration of reactants, catalyst, affect the rate of a reaction. Mathematical
representation of rate of a reaction is given by rate law. It has to be determined
experimentally and cannot be predicted. Order of a reaction with respect to
a reactant is the power of its concentration which appears in the rate law
equation. The order of a reaction is the sum of all such powers of concentration
of terms for different reactants. Rate constant is the proportionality factor in
the rate law. Rate constant and order of a reaction can be determined from rate
law or its integrated rate equation. Molecularity is defined only for an elementary
reaction. Its values are limited from 1 to 3 whereas order can be 0, 1, 2, 3 or
even a fraction. Molecularity and order of an elementary reaction are same.
Temperature dependence of rate constants is described by Arrhenius equation
(k = Ae–Ea/RT). E corresponds to the activation energy and is given by the
a
energy difference between activated complex and the reactant molecules, and A
(Arrhenius factor or pre-exponential factor) corresponds to the collision frequency.
The equation clearly shows that increase of temperature or lowering of E will
a
lead to an increase in the rate of reaction and presence of a catalyst lowers the
activation energy by providing an alternate path for the reaction. According to
collision theory, another factor P called steric factor which refers to the orientation
of molecules which collide, is important and contributes to effective collisions,
thus, modifying the Arrhenius equation to k PZ eEa/RT .
