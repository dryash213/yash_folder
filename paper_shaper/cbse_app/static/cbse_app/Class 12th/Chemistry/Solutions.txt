In this Unit, we will consider mostly liquid
solutions and their formation. This will be followed by
studying the properties of the solutions, like vapour
pressure and colligative properties. We will begin with
types of solutions and then various alternatives in
which concentrations of a solute can be expressed in
liquid solution.
11111.....11111 TTTTTyyyyypppppeeeeesssss ooooofffff Solutions are homogeneous mixtures of two or more than two
SSSSSooooollllluuuuutttttiiiiiooooonnnnnsssss components. By homogenous mixture we mean that its composition
and properties are uniform throughout the mixture. Generally, the
component that is present in the largest quantity is known as solvent.
Solvent determines the physical state in which solution exists. One or
more components present in the solution other than solvent are called
solutes. In this Unit we shall consider only binary solutions (i.e.,
Rationalised 2023-24consisting of two components). Here each component may be
solid, liquid or in gaseous state and are summarised in Table 1.1.

Composition of a solution can be described by expressing its
11111.....22222 EEEEExxxxxppppprrrrreeeeessssssssssiiiiinnnnnggggg
concentration. The latter can be expressed either qualitatively
CCCCCooooonnnnnccccceeeeennnnntttttrrrrraaaaatttttiiiiiooooonnnnn or quantitatively. For example, qualitatively we can say that the
ooooofffff SSSSSooooollllluuuuutttttiiiiiooooonnnnnsssss solution is dilute (i.e., relatively very small quantity of solute)
or it is concentrated (i.e., relatively very large quantity of
solute). But in real life these kinds of description can add to
lot of confusion and thus the need for a quantitative description
of the solution.
There are several ways by which we can describe the concentration
of the solution quantitatively.
(i) Mass percentage (w/w): The mass percentage of a component of a
solution is defined as:
Mass % of a component
Mass of the component in the solution
= 100 (1.1)
Total mass of the solution
For example, if a solution is described by 10% glucose in water by
mass, it means that 10g of glucose is dissolved in 90 g of water
resulting in a 100 g solution. Concentration described by mass
percentage is commonly used in industrial chemical applications.
For example, commercial bleaching solution contains 3.62 mass
percentage of sodium hypochlorite in water.
(ii) Volume percentage (V/V): The volume percentage is defined as:
Volume of the component
Volume % of a component = 100
Total volume of solution
(1.2)
Chemistry 2
Rationalised 2023-24For example, 10% ethanol solution in water means that 10 mL
of ethanol is dissolved in water such that the total volume of
the solution is 100 mL. Solutions containing liquids are commonly
expressed in this unit. For example, a 35% (v/v) solution of
ethylene glycol, an antifreeze, is used in cars for cooling the
engine. At this concentration the antifreeze lowers the freezing
point of water to 255.4K (–17.6°C).
(iii) Mass by volume percentage (w/V): Another unit which is
commonly used in medicine and pharmacy is mass by
volume percentage. It is the mass of solute dissolved in
100 mL of the solution.
(iv) Parts per million: When a solute is present in trace quantities, it
is convenient to express concentration in parts per million (ppm)
and is defined as:
Parts per million =
Numberof parts of the component
×106 (1.3)
Total number of parts of all components of the solution
As in the case of percentage, concentration in parts per million can
also be expressed as mass to mass, volume to volume and mass to
volume. A litre of sea water (which weighs 1030 g) contains about
6 × 10–3 g of dissolved oxygen (O ). Such a small concentration is
2
also expressed as 5.8 g per 106 g (5.8 ppm) of sea water. The
concentration of pollutants in water or atmosphere is often expressed
in terms of mg mL–1 or ppm.
(v) Mole fraction: Commonly used symbol for mole fraction is x and
subscript used on the right hand side of x denotes the component.
It is defined as:
Mole fraction of a component =
Number of moles of the component
(1.4)
Total number of moles of all the components
For example, in a binary mixture, if the number of moles of A and B are
n and n respectively, the mole fraction of A will be
A B
n
x = A (1.5)
A n  n
A B
For a solution containing i number of components, we have:
n n
x = i = i (1.6)
i n  n .......n n
1 2 i i
It can be shown that in a given solution sum of all the mole
fractions is unity, i.e.
x + x + .................. + x = 1 (1.7)
1 2 i
Mole fraction unit is very useful in relating some physical properties
of solutions, say vapour pressure with the concentration of the
solution and quite useful in describing the calculations involving
gas mixtures.

Mole fraction of water can also be calculated as: 1 – 0.068 = 0.932
(vi) Molarity: Molarity (M) is defined as number of moles of solute dissolved
in one litre (or one cubic decimetre) of solution,
Moles of solute
Molarity  (1.8)
Volume of solution in litre
For example, 0.25 mol L–1 (or 0.25 M) solution of NaOH means that
0.25 mol of NaOH has been dissolved in one litre (or one cubic decimetre).

Chemistry 4
Rationalised 2023-24(vii) Molality: Molality (m) is defined as the number of moles of the solute
per kilogram (kg) of the solvent and is expressed as:
Moles of solute
Molality (m) = (1.9)
Mass of solvent in kg
For example, 1.00 mol kg–1 (or 1.00 m) solution of KCl means that
1 mol (74.5 g) of KCl is dissolved in 1 kg of water.
Each method of expressing concentration of the solutions has its
own merits and demerits. Mass %, ppm, mole fraction and molality
are independent of temperature, whereas molarity is a function of
temperature. This is because volume depends on temperature
and the mass does not.

11111.....33333 SSSSSooooollllluuuuubbbbbiiiiillllliiiiitttttyyyyy Solubility of a substance is its maximum amount that can be dissolved
in a specified amount of solvent at a specified temperature. It depends
upon the nature of solute and solvent as well as temperature and
pressure. Let us consider the effect of these factors in solution of a solid
or a gas in a liquid.
5 Solutions
Rationalised 2023-241.3.1 Solubility of Every solid does not dissolve in a given liquid. While sodium chloride
a Solid in a and sugar dissolve readily in water, naphthalene and anthracene do
Liquid not. On the other hand, naphthalene and anthracene dissolve readily in
benzene but sodium chloride and sugar do not. It is observed that
polar solutes dissolve in polar solvents and non polar solutes in non-
polar solvents. In general, a solute dissolves in a solvent if the
intermolecular interactions are similar in the two or we may say like
dissolves like.
When a solid solute is added to the solvent, some solute dissolves
and its concentration increases in solution. This process is known as
dissolution. Some solute particles in solution collide with the solid solute
particles and get separated out of solution. This process is known as
crystallisation. A stage is reached when the two processes occur at the
same rate. Under such conditions, number of solute particles going
into solution will be equal to the solute particles separating out and
a state of dynamic equilibrium is reached.
Solute + Solvent ⇌ Solution (1.10)
At this stage the concentration of solute in solution will remain
constant under the given conditions, i.e., temperature and pressure.
Similar process is followed when gases are dissolved in liquid solvents.
Such a solution in which no more solute can be dissolved at the same
temperature and pressure is called a saturated solution. An
unsaturated solution is one in which more solute can be dissolved at
the same temperature. The solution which is in dynamic equilibrium
with undissolved solute is the saturated solution and contains the
maximum amount of solute dissolved in a given amount of solvent.
Thus, the concentration of solute in such a solution is its solubility.
Earlier we have observed that solubility of one substance into
another depends on the nature of the substances. In addition to these
variables, two other parameters, i.e., temperature and pressure also
control this phenomenon.
Effect of temperature
The solubility of a solid in a liquid is significantly affected by temperature
changes. Consider the equilibrium represented by equation 1.10. This,
being dynamic equilibrium, must follow Le Chateliers Principle. In
general, if in a nearly saturated solution, the dissolution process is
endothermic (D H > 0), the solubility should increase with rise in
sol
temperature and if it is exothermic (D H<0) the solubility should
sol
decrease. These trends are also observed experimentally.
Effect of pressure
Pressure does not have any significant effect on solubility of solids in
liquids. It is so because solids and liquids are highly incompressible
and practically remain unaffected by changes in pressure.
1.3.2 Solubility of Many gases dissolve in water. Oxygen dissolves only to a small extent
a Gas in a in water. It is this dissolved oxygen which sustains all aquatic life. On
Liquid the other hand, hydrogen chloride gas (HCl) is highly soluble in water.
Solubility of gases in liquids is greatly affected by pressure and
Chemistry 6
Rationalised 2023-24temperature. The solubility of gases increase with increase of pressure.
For solution of gases in a solvent, consider a system as shown in
Fig. 1.1 (a). The lower part is solution and the upper part is gaseous
system at pressure p and temperature T. Assume this system to be in
a state of dynamic equilibrium, i.e., under these conditions rate of
gaseous particles entering and leaving the solution phase is the same.
Now increase the pressure over the solution phase by compressing the
gas to a smaller volume [Fig. 1.1 (b)]. This will increase the number of
gaseous particles per unit volume over the solution and also the rate
at which the gaseous particles are striking the surface of solution to
enter it. The solubility of the gas will increase until a new equilibrium
is reached resulting in an increase in the pressure of a gas above the
solution and thus its solubility increases.
Henry was the first to give a
quantitative relation between
pressure and solubility of a gas in
a solvent which is known as
Henry’s law. The law states that
at a constant temperature, the
solubility of a gas in a liquid is
directly proportional to the
partial pressure of the gas
present above the surface of
liquid or solution. Dalton, a
contemporary of Henry, also
Fig. 1.1: Effect of pressure on the solubility of a gas. The concluded independently that the
concentration of dissolved gas is proportional to the
solubility of a gas in a liquid
pressure on the gas above the solution.
solution is a function of partial
pressure of the gas. If we use the mole fraction of a gas in
the solution as a measure of its solubility, then it can be
said that the mole fraction of gas in the solution is
proportional to the partial pressure of the gas over
the solution. The most commonly used form of Henry’s
law states that “the partial pressure of the gas in
vapour phase (p) is proportional to the mole fraction
of the gas (x) in the solution” and is expressed as:
p = K x (1.11)
H
Here K is the Henry’s law constant. If we draw a
H
graph between partial pressure of the gas versus mole
fraction of the gas in solution, then we should get a plot
of the type as shown in Fig. 1.2.
Different gases have different K values at the same
H
temperature (Table 1.2). This suggests that K is a
H
function of the nature of the gas.
It is obvious from equation (1.11) that higher the

76.48 kbar.
SSSSSooooollllluuuuutttttiiiiiooooonnnnn The solubility of gas is related to the mole fraction in aqueous solution.
The mole fraction of the gas in the solution is calculated by applying
Henry’s law. Thus:
p (nitrogen) 0.987bar
x (Nitrogen) = = = 1.29 × 10–5
K 76,480 bar

(n in denominator is neglected as it is < < 55.5)

7.16×104 mol × 1000 mmol
= = 0.716 mmol

Henry’s law finds several applications in industry and explains some
biological phenomena. Notable among these are:
• To increase the solubility of CO in soft drinks and soda water, the
2
bottle is sealed under high pressure.
• Scuba divers must cope with high concentrations of dissolved gases
while breathing air at high pressure underwater. Increased pressure
increases the solubility of atmospheric gases in blood. When the
divers come towards surface, the pressure gradually decreases. This
releases the dissolved gases and leads to the formation of bubbles
of nitrogen in the blood. This blocks capillaries and creates a medical
condition known as bends, which are painful and dangerous to life.
Chemistry 8
Rationalised 2023-24To avoid bends, as well as, the toxic effects of high concentrations
of nitrogen in the blood, the tanks used by scuba divers are filled
with air diluted with helium (11.7% helium, 56.2% nitrogen and
32.1% oxygen).
• At high altitudes the partial pressure of oxygen is less than that at
the ground level. This leads to low concentrations of oxygen in the
blood and tissues of people living at high altitudes or climbers. Low
blood oxygen causes climbers to become weak and unable to think
clearly, symptoms of a condition known as anoxia.
Effect of Temperature
Solubility of gases in liquids decreases with rise in temperature. When
dissolved, the gas molecules are present in liquid phase and the process
of dissolution can be considered similar to condensation and heat
is evolved in this process. We have learnt in the last Section that
dissolution process involves dynamic equilibrium and thus must
follow Le Chatelier’s Principle. As dissolution is an exothermic
process, the solubility should decrease with increase of
temperature.

been discussed in Section 1.3.2. In this Section, we shall discuss the
LLLLLiiiiiqqqqquuuuuiiiiiddddd
solutions of liquids and solids in a liquid. Such solutions may contain
SSSSSooooollllluuuuutttttiiiiiooooonnnnnsssss
one or more volatile components. Generally, the liquid solvent is volatile.
The solute may or may not be volatile. We shall discuss the properties
of only binary solutions, that is, the solutions containing two
components, namely, the solutions of (i) liquids in liquids and (ii) solids
in liquids.
1.4.1 Vapour Let us consider a binary solution of two volatile liquids and denote the

vapour pressures of the two components 1 and 2 respectively. These
partial pressures are related to the mole fractions x and x of the two
1 2
components 1 and 2 respectively.
The French chemist, Francois Marte Raoult (1886) gave the
quantitative relationship between them. The relationship is known as
the Raoult’s law which states that for a solution of volatile liquids,
9 Solutions
Rationalised 2023-24the partial vapour pressure of each component of the solution

Similarly, for component 2

2 2 2
where p 0 represents the vapour pressure of the pure component 2.

According to Dalton’s law of partial pressures, the total pressure
(p ) over the solution phase in the container will be the sum of the
total
partial pressures of the components of the solution and is given as:
p = p + p (1.14)

Substituting the values of p and p , we get

Following conclusions can be drawn from equation (1.16).
(i) Total vapour pressure over the solution can be related to the mole
fraction of any one component.
(ii) Total vapour pressure over the solution varies linearly with the
mole fraction of component 2.
(iii) Depending on the vapour pressures
of the pure components 1 and 2,
total vapour pressure over the
solution decreases or increases with
the increase of the mole fraction of
component 1.

If we compare the equations for Raoult’s law and Henry’s law, it
can be seen that the partial pressure of the volatile component or gas
is directly proportional to its mole fraction in solution. Only the
proportionality constant K differs from p 0. Thus, Raoult’s law becomes

1.4.3 Vapour Another important class of solutions consists of solids dissolved in
Pressure of liquid, for example, sodium chloride, glucose, urea and cane sugar in
Solutions of water and iodine and sulphur dissolved in carbon disulphide. Some
Solids in physical properties of these solutions are quite different from those of
Liquids pure solvents. For example, vapour pressure. Liquids at a given
temperature vapourise and under
equilibrium conditions the pressure exerted
by the vapours of the liquid over the liquid
phase is called vapour pressure [Fig. 1.4 (a)].
In a pure liquid the entire surface is
occupied by the molecules of the liquid. If a
non-volatile solute is added to a solvent to
give a solution [Fig. 1.4.(b)], the vapour
pressure of the solution is solely from the
solvent alone. This vapour pressure of the
solution at a given temperature is found to
be lower than the vapour pressure of the
pure solvent at the same temperature. In
Fig. 1.4: Decrease in the vapour pressure of the the solution, the surface has both solute and
solvent on account of the presence of solvent molecules; thereby the fraction of the
solute in the solvent (a) evaporation of the surface covered by the solvent molecules gets

pressure is also reduced.
The decrease in the vapour pressure of solvent depends on the
quantity of non-volatile solute present in the solution, irrespective of
its nature. For example, decrease in the vapour pressure of water by
adding 1.0 mol of sucrose to one kg of water is nearly similar to that
produced by adding 1.0 mol of urea to the same quantity of water at
the same temperature.
Raoult’s law in its general form can be stated as, for any solution
the partial vapour pressure of each volatile component in the
solution is directly proportional to its mole fraction.
In a binary solution, let us denote the solvent by 1 and solute by
2. When the solute is non-volatile, only the solvent molecules are
present in vapour phase and contribute to vapour pressure. Let p be

Liquid-liquid solutions can be classified into ideal and non-ideal
iiiiidddddeeeeeaaaaalllll SSSSSooooollllluuuuutttttiiiiiooooonnnnnsssss solutions on the basis of Raoult’s law.
1.5.1 Ideal The solutions which obey Raoult’s law over the entire range of
Solutions concentration are known as ideal solutions. The ideal solutions have
two other important properties. The enthalpy of mixing of the
pure components to form the solution is zero and the volume
of mixing is also zero, i.e.,
D H = 0, D V = 0 (1.21)
mix mix
It means that no heat is absorbed or evolved when the components
are mixed. Also, the volume of solution would be equal to the sum of
volumes of the two components. At molecular level, ideal behaviour of
the solutions can be explained by considering two components A and
B. In pure components, the intermolecular attractive interactions will
be of types A-A and B-B, whereas in the binary solutions in addition
to these two interactions, A-B type of interactions will also be present.
If the intermolecular attractive forces between the A-A and B-B are
nearly equal to those between A-B, this leads to the formation of ideal
solution. A perfectly ideal solution is rare but some solutions are nearly
ideal in behaviour. Solution of n-hexane and n-heptane, bromoethane
and chloroethane, benzene and toluene, etc. fall into this category.
1.5.2 Non-ideal When a solution does not obey Raoult’s law over the entire range of
Solutions concentration, then it is called non-ideal solution. The vapour pressure
of such a solution is either higher or lower than that predicted by
Raoult’s law (equation 1.16). If it is higher, the solution exhibits positive
deviation and if it is lower, it exhibits negative deviation from Raoult’s
law. The plots of vapour pressure as a function of mole fractions
for such solutions are shown in Fig. 1.6.
The cause for these deviations lie in the nature of interactions at the
molecular level. In case of positive deviation from Raoult’s law, A-B
interactions are weaker than those between A-A or B-B, i.e., in this case
the intermolecular attractive forces between the solute-solvent molecules
are weaker than those between the solute-solute and solvent-solvent
molecules. This means that in such solutions, molecules of A (or B) will
find it easier to escape than in pure state. This will increase the vapour

pressure and result in positive deviation. Mixtures of ethanol and acetone
behave in this manner. In pure ethanol, molecules are hydrogen bonded.
On adding acetone, its molecules get in between the host molecules and
break some of the hydrogen bonds between them. Due to weakening of
interactions, the solution shows positive deviation from Raoult’s law
[Fig. 1.6 (a)]. In a solution formed by adding carbon disulphide to
acetone, the dipolar interactions between solute-solvent molecules are
weaker than the respective interactions among the solute-solute and
solvent-solvent molecules. This solution also shows positive deviation.
In case of negative deviations from Raoult’s law, the intermolecular
attractive forces between A-A and B-B are weaker than those between
A-B and leads to decrease in vapour pressure resulting in negative
deviations. An example of this type is a mixture of phenol and aniline.
In this case the intermolecular hydrogen bonding between phenolic
proton and lone pair on nitrogen atom of aniline is stronger than the
respective intermolecular hydrogen bonding between similar
molecules. Similarly, a mixture of chloroform and acetone
forms a solution with negative deviation from Raoult’s law.
This is because chloroform molecule is able to form hydrogen
bond with acetone molecule as shown.
This decreases the escaping tendency of molecules for each
component and consequently the vapour pressure decreases resulting
in negative deviation from Raoult’s law [Fig. 1.6. (b)].
Some liquids on mixing, form azeotropes which are binary mixtures
having the same composition in liquid and vapour phase and boil at
a constant temperature. In such cases, it is not possible to separate the
components by fractional distillation. There are two types of azeotropes
called minimum boiling azeotrope and maximum boiling
azeotrope. The solutions which show a large positive deviation from
Raoult’s law form minimum boiling azeotrope at a specific composition.
Chemistry 14
Rationalised 2023-24For example, ethanol-water mixture (obtained by fermentation of sugars)
on fractional distillation gives a solution containing approximately 95%
by volume of ethanol. Once this composition, known as azeotrope
composition, has been achieved, the liquid and vapour have the same
composition, and no further separation occurs.
The solutions that show large negative deviation from Raoult’s law
form maximum boiling azeotrope at a specific composition. Nitric acid
and water is an example of this class of azeotrope. This azeotrope has
the approximate composition, 68% nitric acid and 32% water by mass,
with a boiling point of 393.5 K.

There are many properties of solutions which are connected with this

ooooofffff MMMMMooooolllllaaaaarrrrr MMMMMaaaaassssssssss
(3) elevation of boiling point of the solvent and (4) osmotic pressure of
the solution. All these properties depend on the number of solute
particles irrespective of their nature relative to the total number
of particles present in the solution. Such properties are called
colligative properties (colligative: from Latin: co means together, ligare
means to bind). In the following Sections we will discuss these
properties one by one.
1.6.1 Relative We have learnt in Section 1.4.3 that the vapour pressure of a solvent in
Lowering of solution is less than that of the pure solvent. Raoult established that the
Vapour lowering of vapour pressure depends only on the concentration of the
Pressure solute particles and it is independent of their identity. The equation (1.20)
given in Section 1.4.3 establishes a relation between vapour pressure of
the solution, mole fraction and vapour pressure of the solvent, i.e.,
p = x p 0 (1.22)

The reduction in the vapour pressure of solvent (Dp ) is given as:

Dp = p 0 – p = p 0 – p 0 x

1 1
Knowing that x = 1 – x , equation (1.23) reduces to
2 1
Dp = x p 0 (1.24)
1 2 1
In a solution containing several non-volatile solutes, the lowering of the
vapour pressure depends on the sum of the mole fraction of different solutes.

then, is 0.845 bar. What is the molar mass of the solid substance?
SSSSSooooollllluuuuutttttiiiiiooooonnnnn The various quantities known to us are as follows:
p 0 = 0.850 bar; p = 0.845 bar; M = 78 g mol–1; w = 0.5 g; w = 39 g

Substituting these values in equation (2.28), we get
0.850 bar – 0.845 bar 0.5 g × 78 g mol–1

Therefore, M = 170 g mol–1

1.6.2 Elevation of The vapour pressure of a liquid increases with increase of
BoilingPoint temperature. It boils at the temperature at which its vapour pressure
is equal to the atmospheric pressure. For example, water boils at
373.15 K (100° C) because at this temperature the vapour pressure
of water is 1.013 bar (1 atmosphere). We have also learnt in the last
section that vapour pressure of the solvent decreases in the presence
of non-volatile solute. Fig. 1.7 depicts the variation of vapour pressure
of the pure solvent and solution as a function of temperature. For
example, the vapour pressure of an aqueous solution of sucrose is
less than 1.013 bar at 373.15 K. In order to make this solution
boil, its vapour pressure must be increased to 1.013 bar by
raising the temperature above the boiling temperature of
the pure solvent (water). Thus, the boiling point of a solution is
Chemistry 16
Rationalised 2023-24always higher than that of the boiling point of
the pure solvent in which the solution is prepared
1.013 bar as shown in Fig. 1.7. Similar to lowering of vapour
or pressure, the elevation of boiling point also
depends on the number of solute molecules
rather than their nature. A solution of 1 mol of
sucrose in 1000 g of water boils at 373.52 K at
one atmospheric pressure.

1.6.3 Depression The lowering of vapour pressure of a solution causes a lowering of the
of Freezing freezing point compared to that of the pure solvent (Fig. 1.8). We know
Point that at the freezing point of a substance, the solid phase is in dynamic
equilibrium with the liquid phase. Thus, the
freezing point of a substance may be defined as
the temperature at which the vapour pressure of
the substance in its liquid phase is equal to its
vapour pressure in the solid phase. A solution
will freeze when its vapour pressure equals the
vapour pressure of the pure solid solvent as is
clear from Fig. 1.8. According to Raoult’s law,
when a non-volatile solid is added to the solvent
its vapour pressure decreases and now it would
become equal to that of solid solvent at lower
temperature. Thus, the freezing point of the
solvent decreases.

and Osmotic For example, raw mangoes shrivel when pickled in brine (salt water);
Pressure wilted flowers revive when placed in fresh water, blood cells collapse
when suspended in saline water, etc. If we look into these processes we
find one thing common in all,
that is, all these substances
are bound by membranes.
These membranes can be of
animal or vegetable origin
and these occur naturally
such as pig’s bladder or
parchment or can be
synthetic such as cellophane.
These membranes appear to

Chemistry 20
Rationalised 2023-24molecules, like water, can pass through these holes but the passage of
bigger molecules like solute is hindered. Membranes having this kind
of properties are known as semipermeable membranes (SPM).
Assume that only solvent molecules can pass through these semi-
permeable membranes. If this membrane is placed between the solvent
and solution as shown in Fig. 1.9, the solvent molecules will flow through
the membrane from pure solvent to the solution. This process of flow
of the solvent is called osmosis.
The flow will continue till the equilibrium is attained. The flow of the
solvent from its side to solution side across a semipermeable membrane
can be stopped if some extra pressure is applied on the solution. This
pressure that just stops the flow of solvent is called osmotic
pressure of the solution. The flow of solvent from dilute solution to
the concentrated solution across a semipermeable membrane is due to
osmosis. The important point to be kept in mind is that solvent molecules
always flow from lower concentration to higher concentration of solution.
The osmotic pressure has been found to depend on the concentration
of the solution.
The osmotic pressure of a solution is the
excess pressure that must be applied to a
solution to prevent osmosis, i.e., to stop the
passage of solvent molecules through a
semipermeable membrane into the solution. This
is illustrated in Fig. 1.10. Osmotic pressure is a
colligative property as it depends on the number
of solute molecules and not on their identity.
For dilute solutions, it has been found
experimentally that osmotic pressure is
proportional to the molarity, C of the
solution at a given temperature T. Thus:
P = C R T (1.39)

or M = 2 (1.42)

Thus, knowing the quantities w , T, P and V we can calculate the

molar mass of the solute.
Measurement of osmotic pressure provides another method of
determining molar masses of solutes. This method is widely used to
determine molar masses of proteins, polymers and other
21 Solutions
Rationalised 2023-24macromolecules. The osmotic pressure method has the advantage over
other methods as pressure measurement is around the room
temperature and the molarity of the solution is used instead of molality.
As compared to other colligative properties, its magnitude is large
even for very dilute solutions. The technique of osmotic pressure for
determination of molar mass of solutes is particularly useful for
biomolecules as they are generally not stable at higher temperatures
and polymers have poor solubility.
Two solutions having same osmotic pressure at a given
temperature are called isotonic solutions. When such solutions
are separated by semipermeable membrane no osmosis occurs
between them. For example, the osmotic pressure associated
with the fluid inside the blood cell is equivalent to that of
0.9% (mass/volume) sodium chloride solution, called normal saline
solution and it is safe to inject intravenously. On the other hand, if
we place the cells in a solution containing more than 0.9% (mass/
volume) sodium chloride, water will flow out of the cells and they
would shrink. Such a solution is called hypertonic. If the salt
concentration is less than 0.9% (mass/volume), the solution is said
to be hypotonic. In this case, water will flow into the cells if placed
in this solution and they would swell.

The phenomena mentioned in the beginning of this section can be
explained on the basis of osmosis. A raw mango placed in concentrated
salt solution loses water via osmosis and shrivel into pickle. Wilted
flowers revive when placed in fresh water. A carrot that has become
limp because of water loss into the atmosphere can be placed into the
water making it firm once again. Water will move into its cells through
osmosis. When placed in water containing less than 0.9% (mass/
volume) salt, blood cells swell due to flow of water in them by osmosis.
People taking a lot of salt or salty food experience water retention in
tissue cells and intercellular spaces because of osmosis. The resulting
Chemistry 22
Rationalised 2023-24puffiness or swelling is called edema. Water movement from soil into
plant roots and subsequently into upper portion of the plant is partly
due to osmosis. The preservation of meat by salting and of fruits by
adding sugar protects against bacterial action. Through the process
of osmosis, a bacterium on salted meat or candid fruit loses water,
shrivels and dies.
1.6.5 Reverse The direction of osmosis can be reversed if a pressure larger than the
Osmosis and osmotic pressure is applied to the solution side. That is, now the
Water pure solvent flows out of the solution through the semi permeable
Purification membrane. This phenomenon is called reverse osmosis and is of
great practical utility. Reverse osmosis is used in desalination of sea
water. A schematic set up for the process is shown in Fig. 1.11.
When pressure more than osmotic pressure is
applied, pure water is squeezed out of the sea
water through the membrane. A variety of
Π
polymer membranes are available for this
purpose.
The pressure required for the reverse osmosis
is quite high. A workable porous membrane is a
film of cellulose acetate placed over a suitable
support. Cellulose acetate is permeable to water
but impermeable to impurities and ions present
in sea water. These days many countries use

the solution. If this happens, there would be two moles of particles in
the solution. If we ignore interionic attractions, one mole of KCl in
one kg of water would be expected to increase the boiling point by
2 × 0.52 K = 1.04 K. Now if we did not know about the degree of
23 Solutions
Rationalised 2023-24dissociation, we could be led to conclude that the mass of 2 mol particles
is 74.5 g and the mass of one mole of KCl would be 37.25 g. This
brings into light the rule that, when there is dissociation of solute into
ions, the experimentally determined molar mass is always lower than
the true value.
2 CH COOH ⇌ (CH COOH) Molecules of ethanoic acid (acetic acid) dimerise in
3 3 2
benzene due to hydrogen bonding. This normally happens
in solvents of low dielectric constant. In this case the number
of particles is reduced due to dimerisation. Association of
molecules is depicted as follows:
It can be undoubtedly stated here that if all the molecules of ethanoic
acid associate in benzene, then DT or DT for ethanoic acid will be half
b f
of the normal value. The molar mass calculated on the basis of this DT
b
or DT will, therefore, be twice the expected value. Such a molar mass
f
that is either lower or higher than the expected or normal value is called
as abnormal molar mass.
In 1880 van’t Hoff introduced a factor i, known as the van’t Hoff
factor, to account for the extent of dissociation or association. This
factor i is defined as:
Normal molar mass
i 
Abnormal molar mass
Observed colligative property

Calculated colligative property
Total number of moles of particles after association/dissociation
i 
Number of moles of particles before association/dissociation
Here abnormal molar mass is the experimentally determined molar
mass and calculated colligative properties are obtained by assuming
that the non-volatile solute is neither associated nor dissociated. In
case of association, value of i is less than unity while for dissociation it
is greater than unity. For example, the value of i for aqueous KCl
solution is close to 2, while the value for ethanoic acid in benzene is
nearly 0.5.

A solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances. Solutions are
classified as solid, liquid and gaseous solutions. The concentration of a solution is
expressed in terms of mole fraction, molarity, molality and in percentages. The
dissolution of a gas in a liquid is governed by Henry’s law, according to which, at a
given temperature, the solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to
the partial pressure of the gas. The vapour pressure of the solvent is lowered by
the presence of a non-volatile solute in the solution and this lowering of vapour
pressure of the solvent is governed by Raoult’s law, according to which the relative
lowering of vapour pressure of the solvent over a solution is equal to the mole
fraction of a non-volatile solute present in the solution. However, in a binary
liquid solution, if both the components of the solution are volatile then another
form of Raoult’s law is used. Mathematically, this form of the Raoult’s law is stated
as:p  p0x p0x . Solutions which obey Raoult’s law over the entire range
total 1 1 2 2
of concentration are called ideal solutions. Two types of deviations from Raoult’s
law, called positive and negative deviations are observed. Azeotropes arise due to
very large deviations from Raoult’s law.
The properties of solutions which depend on the number of solute particles and
are independent of their chemical identity are called colligative properties. These
are lowering of vapour pressure, elevation of boiling point, depression of freezing
point and osmotic pressure. The process of osmosis can be reversed if a pressure
higher than the osmotic pressure is applied to the solution. Colligative properties
have been used to determine the molar mass of solutes. Solutes which dissociate in
solution exhibit molar mass lower than the actual molar mass and those which
associate show higher molar mass than their actual values.
Quantitatively, the extent to which a solute is dissociated or associated can be
expressed by van’t Hoff factor i. This factor has been defined as ratio of normal
molar mass to experimentally determined molar mass or as the ratio of observed
colligative property to the calculated colligative property.
