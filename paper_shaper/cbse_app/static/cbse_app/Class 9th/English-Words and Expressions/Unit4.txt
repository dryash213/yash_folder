Text I
The WoRld as i see iT
In my opinion, the present symptoms of decadence are
explained by the fact that the development of industry and
machinery has made the struggle for existence very much
more severe, greatly to the detriment of the free development
of the individual. But the development of machinery means decadence: moral or
cultural decline as
that less and less work is needed from the individual for the
characterised by excessive
satisfaction of the community’s needs. A planned division
indulgence in pleasure or
of labour is becoming more and more of a crying necessity luxury
and this division will lead to the material security of the
individual. This security and the spare time and energy detriment: the state of
being harmed or damaged
which the individual will have at his command can be made
to further his development. In this way the community may
regain its health, and we will hope that future historians will
explain the morbid symptoms of present-day society as the
childhood ailments of an aspiring humanity, due entirely to
the excessive speed at which civilisation was advancing.

When einsTein WRoTe To gandhi
In 1931, Albert Einstein wrote the following short letter
of admiration to another of the world’s greatest minds,
Mohandas Gandhi. Despite their intentions, the pair never
met in person.
Respected Mr. Gandhi,

your example will spread beyond the borders of the country,
and will help to establish an international authority, respected

With sincere admiration
Yours
(Signed, ‘A. Einstein’)
I hope that I will be able to meet you face to face someday.

Except the Will which says to them: “Hold on”;

Or walk with kings—nor lose the common touch;
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you;
If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run—
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,
And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!

was the den of a famous robber chief, Angulimala. He was
the terror of the whole countryside. He lived by plundering
travellers and feared no one. He had committed many
murders. All attempts to capture the inhuman Angulimala
had failed. So he continued his crimes unpunished. The
people of Kosala pleaded with the Buddha not to expose
himself to the dangers of the robber’s territory.
But Gautama Buddha knew no fear. The warnings of the
people of Kosala did not affect him. He made his way into
the jungle. Angulimala got enraged at this boldness. He was

confident and in control of
calm and self-possessed, and heard his words of kindness,

the robber hesitated. His arm, which had been uplifted to kill,
fell helpless by his side. His wrath cooled, and he knelt down
before the Buddha. He confessed all his sins and declared his
faith in the Buddha. When the people saw the new disciple
following his Master, they were amazed and could not believe
that this was the ferocious man who had been a terror for
so long. Angulimala became a monk. His past was forgotten,
and he was widely respected for his holiness.
