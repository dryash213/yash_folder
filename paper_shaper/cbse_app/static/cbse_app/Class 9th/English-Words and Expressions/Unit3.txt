This is an extract from Harper Lee’s To Kill a Mocking Bird.
After supper, Atticus sat down with the paper and called,
“Scout, ready to read?”. I ran crying, went to the front
porch. Atticus followed me. “Something wrong, Scout?” I
told Atticus I didn’t feel very well and didn’t think I’d go to
school any more if it was alright with him. Atticus sat down
in the swing and crossed his legs. His fingers wandered
to his watch pocket; he said that was the only way he
could think. He waited in amiable silence, and I sought to
reinforce my position: “You never went to school and you
do alright, so I’ll just stay home too. You can teach me like
Granddaddy taught you ‘n’ Uncle Jack.” “No I can’t”, said

jail if I kept you at home. Now what’s the matter? Bit by
bit, I told him the day’s misfortunes. “And the teacher said
you taught me all wrong, so we can’t ever read any more,
ever. Please don’t send me back, please Sir.” Atticus stood

up and walked to the end of the porch. When he completed
flowering plants
his examination of the wisteria vine he strolled back to
me. “First of all”, he said, “if you can learn a simple trick,
Scout, you’ll get along a lot better with all kinds of folks.
You never really understand a person until you consider
things from his point of view-” “Sir?” “-until you climb into
his skin and walk around in it”. “But if I keep on goin’
to school, we can’t ever read any more…” “That’s really
bothering you, isn’t it?” “Yes sir.”
When Atticus looked down at me I saw the expression

on his face that always made me expect something. “Do you
two or more people as to what
know what a compromise is?”, he asked. “Bending the law?” each will do for the other
“No, an agreement reached by mutual concessions. It works
this way”, he said. “If you’ll concede the necessity of going
to school, we’ll go on reading every night just as we always
have. Is it a bargain?”
“Yes sir!”
“We’ll consider it sealed without the usual formality”,
Atticus said, when he saw me preparing to spit.
As I opened the front screen door Atticus said, “By the
disapprobation: strong moral
way, Scout, you’d better not say anything at school about disapproval
our agreement”. “Why not?” “I’m afraid our activities would
be received with considerable disapprobation by the more
learned authorities.”
My brother and I were accustomed to our father’s
diction, and we were at all times free to interrupt Atticus for a
translation when it was beyond our understanding. “Huh, Sir?”
“I never went to school”, he said, “but I have a feeling
that if you tell Miss Caroline we read every night she’ll get
after me, and I wouldn’t want her after me”.
