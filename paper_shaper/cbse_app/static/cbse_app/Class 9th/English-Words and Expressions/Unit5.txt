THE MIRACULOUS ESCAPE
I had been very wealthy and prosperous and was leading
a very comfortable life. I had all the worldly pleasures with
me. But soon I became bored of my idle life. The urge to go
on a voyage became stronger and stronger day by day. It
haunted me like anything. So one day I boarded a ship and
went trading from island to island with other merchants.
When we started, the weather was fine and the sea was
calm. But on the fourth day of our voyage, our ship was
caught in a terrific/terrible hurricane and we wandered
from our set course. The tempest continued for several
days and drove us near an island. The captain of the ship
2024-25
Unit 5.indd 67 1/7/2019 10:06:19 AMwas reluctant to cast anchor at the port as it was a much
dreaded place.
The violent waves of the sea had exhausted us. We were
all tired and hungry so we went in search of food and water.
We were fortunate enough to find fruit trees and a stream of
fresh and cool water which gave us strength and energy and
relieved us from hunger.
It had started getting dark. As we were tired we went to
rustle: make a soft, muffled
crackling sound like that sleep but were soon startled by a rustling noise which came
caused by the movement of
from a very long and huge python like serpent gliding swiftly
dry leaves or paper
towards us. We ran to save our lives but the serpent was
quick enough to swallow one of my companions. We kept
running till we had covered a good enough distance from the
serpent. We felt a bit relieved but at the same time sad as we
had lost a friend of ours. We took shelter on the top of a tree
and thought ourselves to be safe.
But we were mistaken for we had hardly slept a little
alarm: a warning of danger time when we heard a hissing sound which alarmed and
frightened us. Coiling itself round the tree, the serpent
reached my other companion who was positioned somewhat
lower than me on the tree. It swallowed him and went away.
Terror stricken I clung to the branch of the tree tightly
and I did not know when I fell asleep. It was daylight when
I awoke. I climbed down. It seemed to me that I had no
courage left. It took me no time to realise that if I would not
think of a way to escape soon, I would be a dead man. It was
just a matter of time when I would also be swallowed like my
two other companions. The instinct to prevent one’s life is
greater than any fear or frustration.
I thought I should spare no means to save myself. I
collected a lot of dry wood and bushes and tied them into a
bundle with reeds. I arranged them in a circular structure
round the tree and tied some of them with the branches of
the tree. In this way I made a tent like structure in which
I sat after dusk and securely tied from within. I had the
penetrate: force a way into
or through satisfaction that whatever I could do I did it to prevent
myself. This time when the serpent arrived he crept round
the tree but he could not penetrate the defensive structure I
had made around me. It just sat and waited the whole night
like a cat that waits for the mouse to emerge out of its hole.

A hungry dog while searching about food found a bone. He
picked it out and held it tightly in his mouth and ran out into
the woods, to a safe place to enjoy it in ease. He growled and
frowned at anyone who attempted to take it over. He chewed
the bone for a very long time and this made him quite thirsty.
He came to a stream to quench his thirst. He trotted around

dog with a bigger bone, he growled and scowled towards
it. The reflection growled and scowled back. Being greedy
by nature, he wanted that bone too. He snapped his sharp
teeth at the image on the water. He barked at the other dog,
hoping to scare him into giving that bone. His own big bone
fell with a splash, went over of sight, the moment he opened
his mouth to bite!

How brave are you? Take a minute to think over this question.
There are people who risk their lives to save someone’s life
from danger. Here is a child who dared and saved lives. Let
us listen to the story of a braveheart.
The Brave Hearts
On October 26, 2009, Jhalaram’s hut in the village
Sarneshwar in Rajasthan, suddenly caught fire. His two
daughters, aged two-and-a-half years and one year, as well
as ten goats were in the hut at that time.

Unit 5.indd 74 30-05-2018 11:52:48Shrawan Kumar, a six-year old boy, was playing in his
house at a distance of about 200 feet. Seeing smoke coming
out from Jhalaram’s house, he ran towards it. He saw the
children sitting on a cot and screaming for help, and the
goats caught in the flames.
Shrawan entered the house, lifted the younger child in
one arm and pulling the older one by the hand, brought
them out safely. He took them to his house, then ran to
inform his father and the children’s father.
The elders rushed to the site. But by that time, the goats
had died and the household belongings had been destroyed
in the fire. It was Shrawan Kumar’s daring act that saved
the lives of the two children.

1. The stories of ‘The Snake and the Mirror’ and ‘The
Miraculous Escape’ show how people face danger and
are scared of animals. As children, many of us fear stray
dogs. Both adults and children are scared of snakes.
Fear exists in most of us. Some fears have bases and
others do not. Let us conduct a survey of what people
fear about. You may follow the guidelines given below.
• Form groups of four, and select an area for your survey. It may be
your classmates, teachers or people in your neighbourhood.
• Develop a questionnaire to collect information about the fears people
have. You may have at least eight to ten questions.
• Decide how many people you will ask the questions for the survey.
• Ask people the questions.
• Write their opinions in tabular form.
• Now write the first draft of the report.
• You may add graphic representations of the information and the data
collected.
• Edit and write the report to make it final.
• Present it in a report form to the class.
• You can also make a PowerPoint presentation.
